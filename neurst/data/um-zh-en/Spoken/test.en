The Creature in the Shop
My name is Dr Frederick Treves. I am a doctor at the London Hospital.
One day in 1884, I saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital.
I stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture.
At first I felt interested, then I felt angry, then afraid.
There was a man in the picture, but he did not look like you and me.
He did not look like a man. He looked like an elephant.
I read the writing under the picture. It said：Come in and see the Elephant Man. 2 pence.
I opened the door and went in.
There was a man in the shop. He was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth.
‘What do you want？’he asked.
‘I'd like to see the elephant man, please, ’I said.
The man looked at me angrily.
‘Well, you can't, ’ he said. ‘The shop's closing now. You can come back tomorrow. ’
‘I'm sorry, ’I said. ‘ But I would like to see him now. I have no time tomorrow—I have a lot of work to do. But I can give you more than 2 pence. ’
The man looked at me carefully. Then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth.
‘All right, sir, ’he said. ‘Give me twelve pence then. ’
I gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop.
We went into a little room. The room was cold and dark, and there was a horrible smell in it.
A creature sat on a chair behind a table.
I say a creature, because it was not a man or a woman, like you or me.
The creature did not move or look at us. It sat very quietly on the chair in the cold, dark, dirty room, and looked at the table. On the table in front of it, there was a dead flower.
‘Stand up! ’said the shopkeeper, loudly.
The creature stood up slowly. It took the old cloth off its head, and put it on the chair.
I looked at the creature and felt sad.
I am a doctor, so I know a lot about accidents and ill people.
I see horrible, ugly things every day. But this creature, this thing, was the worst of all.
There were no men or women in the hospital like him.
He wore some old trousers, but no shirt, coat, or shoes, so I could see his body very well.
His head was the most interesting thing. It was very, very big—like an enormous bag with a lot of books in it.
The head did not have much hair, and there was another bag of brown, dirty skin at the back of it. This skin came down below his neck.
I could not see one of his eyes very well, because a lot of skin came down in front of his face, too.
An enormous red tooth came out of his mouth, under his nose. It looked like an elephant's tooth. The mouth and nose were like holes in the face. The face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad, because the skin could not move. It was dead, like an elephant's face.
There were more bags of dirty skin on the front and back of the creature's body. These bags came down to his legs.
The right arm was enormous, and there were bags of skin on it, too. The right hand was like a man's foot.
But the left hand the left arm and the left hand were beautiful! The left arm had wonderful skin, and the fingers of the left hand were long and beautiful. It was like a young woman's hand!
‘Walk, Merrick! ’ said the shopkeeper angrily. ‘Come on, quickly, move! ’
He hit the creature with his hand.
Slowly, the creature walked across the room.
But he could not walk well. His legs were very big and fat, and he had a bad back. He could not walk far without a stick.
‘All right, thank you, ’I said. ‘Let him sit down. I don't want to see any more. ’
I felt ill, and the smell in the room was very bad.
‘Yes, sir, ’said the shopkeeper. ‘Sit down, Merrick. ’
We went out of the room and closed the door.
The shopkeeper smiled at me with his yellow teeth.
‘Wonderful, sir, isn't it？’he said. ‘The best Elephant Man in England! Hundreds of people come to see him, you know, hundreds! I take him all over the country, I do! ’
‘Yes, very interesting, ’I said. ‘Can I sit down？’
‘Yes, sir, of course. Here's a chair. ’He looked at me, smiling. ‘Would you like a glass of water, sir？’
‘Yes, please, ’I said.
Then I looked at the things in the dirty shop. There were two or three bad apples and some old black bananas：that was all.
‘Er, no…no, thank you. I'm all right, ’I said. ‘Did you…did you call the creature Merrick？’
‘That's right, sir. Joseph Merrick. The best ElephantMan in England! I take him all over the country, you know. Lots of people want to see him. ’
'What do you want?' said Mr Dombey.
'If you please, Sir, I wish to speak to you,' said Susan.
Mr Dombey moved his lips as if he were repeating the words, but he seemed so lost in astonishment at the presumption of the young woman as to be incapable of giving them utterance.
'I have been in your service, Sir,' said Susan Nipper, with her usual rapidity, 'now twelve 'year a waiting on Miss Floy my own young lady who couldn't speak plain when I first come here and I was old in this house when Mrs Richards was new, I may not be Meethosalem, but I am not a child in arms.'
"You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study."
"This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our results. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?"
"Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House."
Well, what happened?
Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment.
By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.
Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.
You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!
“What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you’ve made of it the phrase ‘pig’s ear’ comes irresistibly to my mind.”
“But I was President of the Galaxy, man!”
“Huh,” muttered his ancestor, “And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?”
“Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!”
“Conceited little megapuppy.”
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.
“Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather.”
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn’t feel a thing.
“You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. You know because you’ve been it, and I know because I’m dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here. ‘Life is wasted on the living.’”
“Yeah,” said Zaphod bitterly, “very good. Very deep.
Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.”
“Fifty seconds,” grunted Ford Prefect.
“Where was I?” said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
“Pontificating,” said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
“That’s right guys,” the computer sang out suddenly.
“just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it’s a biggy. Be with you in a while.” It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent.
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing.
The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force-shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn’t be around for long.
Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it.
“Three minutes and fifty seconds,” he said a short while later.
“Forty-five seconds,” he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look.
“Dying for a cup of tea, eh?” he said. “Three minutes and forty seconds.”
“Will you stop counting!” snarled Zaphod.
“Yes,” said Ford Prefect, “in three minutes and thirty-five seconds.”
To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards the revolution.
At the slightest provocation they make arrests, crown the arrested with tall paper hats, and parade them through the villages, saying, "You dirty landlords, now you know who we are! "
Since this theory impedes the rise of the peasant movement and so disrupts the revolution, we must firmly oppose it.
"We joined the peasant association long ago," they say to the rich peasants, "why are you still hesitating? # The rich peasants answer mockingly, "What is there to keep you from joining? # You people have neither a tile over your heads nor a speck of land under your feet! "
We must combat the counter-revolutionary talk of a "movement of riffraff" and a "movement of lazy peasants" and must be especially careful not to commit the error of helping the local tyrants and evil gentry in their attacks on the poor peasant class.
Therefore, our present task is to lead the peasants to put their greatest efforts into the political struggle, so that the landlords' authority is entirely overthrown.
"Well, well," said Holmes gleefully, "you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac."
"Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes," said the inspector with satisfaction.
"But this may all fit in with your theories," I remarked.
"That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this man?"
So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification.
There were no papers or letters, and no marking upon the clothes.
A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table.
He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.
"That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes," said White Mason.
If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist.
As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.
So one would imagine.
Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken.
But his description--what of that?
MacDonald referred to his notebook.
He stopped again, as if to discover whether he had led Mr Dombey far enough yet. And again, with his chin resting on his hand, he leered at the picture.
'Carker,' said Mr Dombey, 'I am sensible that you do not limit your - '
'Service,' suggested his smiling entertainer.
'No; I prefer to say your regard,' observed Mr Dombey; very sensible, as he said so, that he was paying him a handsome and flattering compliment, 'to our mere business relations. Your consideration for my feelings, hopes, and disappointments, in the little instance you have just now mentioned, is an example in point. I I am obliged to you, Carker.'
“Yes,” said Ford Prefect, “in three minutes and thirty-five seconds.”
Experience has shown that in enemy-occupied areas it is best not to magnify the class contradiction among the Chinese; the basic idea should be to unite all Chinese in the fight against the enemy.
Experience has also shown that achieving unity of the Chinese against the enemy involves a struggle, too.
Fifth, they should at all times secretly look after the interests of the Chinese people, especially anti-Japanese revolutionaries.
Doing Everything to Safeguard the Interests of the Chinese People.
Members of our guerrilla units and armed working teams in enemy-occupied areas should aim at safeguarding the interests of the Chinese people; this is a matter of preserving the might of the country and building up our strength and is the starting point of our revolutionary work in these areas.
Since there are 450 million people in China and only 2 billion people in the world, our victory will mean the victory of one-fourth of the world's population.
Therefore, opposing feudalism is a fundamental task of the Chinese revolution.
In “Introducing The Communist”, Chairman Mao pointed out that the united front, armed struggle and Party building are the three fundamental questions in the Chinese revolution.
The reason for our victory in the Chinese revolution was that we successfully handled the three questions.
In China most of the minority nationalities live in the northwest and southwest.
Historically, China's minority nationalities have been estranged to a high degree from the Han nationality.
We should convince the various minority nationality people that, politically, all nationalities within China's boundaries are truly equal, that their living standards can be improved and that their cultural level can be raised.
In China, Mao Zedong Thought -- the integration of the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution --can also help solve this problem.
The Characteristics of the Chinese Bourgeoisie.
The Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held 11 years ago, laid down the following principle: we shall integrate the universal truth of Marxism and Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution as a guide for our country's revolution and development.
These were the first words of antagonism.
To fling elaborate sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or cat.
The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled.
She remained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her.
She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope.
Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life, in his universe, returned to him, and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood.
Some consequent action was necessary; yet what?
'Tess,' he said, as gently as he could speak, 'I cannot stay - in this room - just now. I will walk out a little way.'
He quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supper - one for her, one for him - remained on the table untasted.
This was what their Agape had come to.
At tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk from one cup.
The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled to, roused Tess from her stupor.
He was gone; she could not stay.
Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed, putting out the candles as if she were never coming back.
The rain was over and the night was now clear.
She was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without purpose.
His form beside her light gray figure looked black, sinister, and forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud.
Clare turned at hearing her footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference in him, and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house.
The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain having been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.
Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed;
she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them there - the vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean.
The place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same valley as Talbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him.
Away from the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him, but with dumb and vacant fidelity.
At last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and still he said nothing.
The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now.
The outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse; she knew that he saw her without irradiation - in all her bareness;
that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then--
Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee shall hate;
Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate.
For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain;
And the veil of thine head shall be grief, and the crown shall be pain.
He was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought.
What a weak thing her presence must have become to him!
She could not help addressing Clare.
'What have I done - what have I done! I have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you. You don't think I planned it, do you? It is in your own mind what you are angry at, Angel; it is not in me. O, it is not in me, and I am not that deceitful woman you think me!'
'H'm - well. Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same. No, not the same. But do not make me reproach you. I have sworn that I will not; and I will do everything to avoid it.'
But she went on pleading in her distraction; and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence.
'Angel! - Angel! I was a child - a child when it happened! I knew nothing of men.'
'You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.'
'Then will you not forgive me?'
'I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all.'
'And love me?'
To this question he did not answer.
O Angel - my mother says that it sometimes happens so!
- she knows several cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not minded it much - has got over it at least.
And yet the woman has not loved him as I do you!
Don't, Tess; don't argue.
Different societies, different manners.
You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things.
You don't know what you say.
'I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!'
She spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.
So much the worse for you.
I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue.
I cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other fact - of your want of firmness.
Decrepit families imply decrepit wills, decrepit conduct.
Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent!
Here was I thinking you a new-sprung child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy!
Her narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary explanations were done.
Tess's voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind, and she had not wept.
But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed.
The fire in the grate looked impish - demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least about her strait.
The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care.
The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem.
All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration.
And yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of things.
But the essence of things had changed.
When she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corners of their brains, repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness.
Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him.
After stirring the embers he rose to his feet; all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now.
His face had withered.
In the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor.
He could not, by any contrivance, think closely enough; that was the meaning of his vague movement.
When he spoke it was in the most inadequate, commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him.
'Tess!'
'Yes, dearest.'
Am I to believe this?
From your manner I am to take it as true.
O you cannot be out of your mind!
You ought to be! Yet you are not... . My wife, my Tess - nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that?'
'I am not out of my mind,' she said.
'And yet--' He looked vacantly at her, to resume with dazed senses: 'Why didn't you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a way - but I hindered you, I remember!'
These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed.
He turned away, and bent over a chair.
Tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep.
Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and from this position she crouched in a heap.
'In the name of our love, forgive me!' she whispered with a dry mouth. 'I have forgiven you for the same!'
And, as he did not answer, she said again--
'Forgive me as you are forgiven! I forgive you, Angel.'
'You - yes, you do.'
'But you do not forgive me?'
'O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one person; now you are another. My God - how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque - prestidigitation as that!'
He paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into horrible laughter - as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.
'Don't - don't! It kills me quite, that!' she shrieked. 'O have mercy upon me - have mercy!'
He did not answer; and, sickly white, she jumped up.
'Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?' she cried out.'Do you know what this is to me?'
He shook his head.
'I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy! I have thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not! That's what I have felt, Angel!'
'I know that.'
I thought, Angel, that you loved me - me, my very self!
If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so?
It frightens me!
Having begun to love you, I love you for ever - in all changes, in all disgraces, because you are yourself.
I ask no more.
Then how can you, O my own husband, stop loving me?
'I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.'
'But who?'
'Another woman in your shape.'
She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times.
He looked upon her as a species of impostor; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one.
Terror was upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole.
The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered; and he stepped forward, thinking she was going to fall.
'Sit down, sit down,' he said gently. 'You are ill; and it is natural that you should be.'
She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep.
'I don't belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?, she asked helplessly. 'It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he says.'
The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used. Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.
Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals.
'Angel,' she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice of terror having left her now. 'Angel, am I too wicked for you and me to live together?'
'I have not been able to think what we can do.'
'I shan't ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have no right to! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married, as I said I would do; and I shan't finish the good-hussif I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings.'
'Shan't you?'
'No, I shan't do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away from me I shall not follow 'ee; and if you never speak to me any more I shall not ask why, unless you tell me I may.'
'And if I do order you to do anything?'
'I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down and die.'
'You are very good. But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of self-preservation.'
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
This was invitation enough.
Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.
What is his name?
Is he married or single?
"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
"How so? how can it affect them?"
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
"Is that his design in settling here?"
"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."
My dear, you flatter me.
I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
"But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.
When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."
Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.
Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.
Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
I cannot quite agree with you there.
What say you, Mary?
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.
Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley."
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.
I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before?
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!
But I knew I should persuade you at last.
I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.
Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there.
Every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence, and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual.
Its transcendental aspirations - still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things, a zenithal paradise, a nadiral hell - were as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet.
Latterly he had seen only Life, felt only the great passionate pulse of existence, unwarped, uncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate.
On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence from the Angel Clare of former times.
It was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly bis brothers.
He was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more.
The manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner of the drawing-room young man.
A prig would have said that he had lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse.
Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains.
After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical, well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest fibre; such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition.
They were both somewhat shortsighted, and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass; when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway, all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision.
When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves.
When Correggio's Holy Families were admired, they admired Correggio's Holy Families; when he was decried in favour of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection.
If these two noticed Angel's growing social ineptness, he noticed their growing mental limitations.
Felix seemed to him all Church; Cuthbert all College.
His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the main-springs of the world to the one; Cambridge to the other.
Each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant scores of millions of outsiders in civilized society, persons who were neither University men nor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected.
They were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their visits to their parents.
Felix, though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was less self-sacrificing and disinterested.
More tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching.
Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded, though, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.
'I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,' Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity.
And, therefore, we must make the best of it.
But I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals.
Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless.
'Of course it may,' said Angel. 'Was it not proved nineteen hundred years ago - if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals?'
'Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our conversation - It may be fancy only - that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp. Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?'
Now, Felix, said Angel drily,
we are very good friends, you know; each of us treading our allotted circles;
but if it comes to intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.
They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually concluded.
Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.
The walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now an outdoor man, accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairyman's somewhat coarsely-laden table.
But neither of the old people had arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered. The self-denying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners, whom they, somewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh, their own appetites being quite forgotten.
The family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them.
Angel looked round for Mrs Crick's black-puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled, as they did them at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself.
'Of course,' said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.
'I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,' continued his mother, 'that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my medicine-closet.'
'We never drink spirits at this table, on principle,' added his father.
'But what shall I tell the dairyman's wife?' said Angel.
'The truth, of course,' said his father.
'I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.'
'You cannot, if we did not,' Mr Clare answered lucidly.
'AH - no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.'
'A what?' said Cuthbert and Felix both.
'Oh--'tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,' replied Angel, blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.
Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who had won him having retired to her chamber.
The night was as sultry as the day.
There was no coolness after dark unless on the grass.
Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the barton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontide temperature into the noctambulist's face.
He sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think of himself.
Feeling had indeed smothered judgment that day.
Since the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept apart.
She seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred, while the novelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance disquieted him - palpitating, contemplative being that he was.
He could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet, and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward.
Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life, soon passed through and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman--
Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, How curious you are to me!
resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew.
But, behold, the absorbing scene had been imported hither.
What had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show; while here, in this apparently dim and un-impassioned place, novelty had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up elsewhere.
This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause - her all; her every and only chance.
To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun.
Living in such close relations, to meet meant to fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and, having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency, he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged.
As yet the harm done was small. But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her.
He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.
He thought he would go and see his friends.
It might be possible to sound them upon this.
In less than five months his term here would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge, and in a position to start on his own account.
Would not a farmer want a wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a woman who understood farming?
Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey.
One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.
'O no,' said Dairyman Crick. 'Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk.'
For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.
But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness.
'He's getting on towards the end of his time wi' me,' added the dairyman, with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal;
and so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere.
Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease:
and now, as they again confronted him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an aura over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which wellnigh produced a qualm;
and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic sneeze.
She then became conscious that he was observing her;
but she would not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge of it was left.
The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down.
Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears, fell back like a defeated battalion.
He lumped up from his seat, and, leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind, went quickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down beside her, clasped her in his arms.
Tess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness.
Having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she sank upon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an ecstatic cry.
He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he checked himself, for tender conscience' sake.
'Forgive me, Tess dear!' he whispered.
I ought to have asked.
I - did not know what I was doing.
I do not mean it as a liberty.
I am devoted to you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!'
Old Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled;
and seeing two people crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should have been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.
'She is angry - she doesn't know what we mean - she'll kick over the milk!' exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes concerned with the quadruped's actions, her heart more deeply concerned with herself and Clare.
She slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still encircling her.
Tess's eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.
'Why do you cry, my darling?' he said.
'O - I don't know!' she murmured.
As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw.
'Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,' said he, with a curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgment.
'That I - love you dearly and truly I need not say. But I - it shall go no further now - it distresses you - I am as surprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness - been too quick and unreflecting, will you?'
'N' - I can't tell.'
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
But consider your daughters.
I desire you will do no such thing.
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.
But you are always giving her the preference.
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves."
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."
"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
"It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all."
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.
Her mind was less difficult to develope.
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
'Never mind that,' she coaxed.
'Put me down, I beg you. I don't mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!'
She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss.
He sprang down on the other side.
'I suppose I must hold the horse?' said she.
'Oh no; it's not necessary,' replied Alec, patting the panting creature. 'He's had enough of it for to-night.'
He turned the horse's head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
'Now, you sit there,' he said.
The leaves have not got damp as yet.
Just give an eye to the horse - it will be quite sufficient.'
He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, 'By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.'
'Somebody? You!'
D'Urberville nodded.
'O how very good of you that is!' she exclaimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.
And the children have some toys.'
'I didn't know - you ever sent them anything!' she murmured, much moved. 'I almost wish you had not - yes, I almost wish it!'
'Why, dear?'
'It - hampers me so.'
'Tessy - don't you love me ever so little now?'
He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down.
'You have only that puffy muslin dress on - how's that?'
'It's my best summer one. 'Twas very warm when I started, and I didn't know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.'
