My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another, but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes, you'll see a little bit of a relation.
It ties to origami.
So let me start.
What is origami?
Most people think they know what origami is.
It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
And that is what origami used to be.
But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding, is how we create the form.
You know, it's very old.
This is a plate from 1797.
It shows these women playing with these toys.
If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane.
So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only -- everything that could done has been done a long time ago.
And that might have been the case.
But in the 20th century, a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along, and he created tens of thousands of new designs.
But even more importantly, he created a language -- a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows.
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk, we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection, and we know where that leads.
And where it has led in origami is to things like this.
This is an origami figure: one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.
This too is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.
You can get horns, antlers -- even if you look close, cloven hooves.
And it raises a question: what changed?
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art, which is math.
That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws.
And that leads to a very powerful tool.
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you.
Because what you can do is take your problem and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions.
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure.
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
They have to obey four simple laws.
And they're very simple, easy to understand.
The first law is two-colorability.
You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting.
The directions of the folds at any vertex --the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --always differs by two.
Two more or two less.
Nothing else.
If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
All the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold.
So that's four simple laws.
That's all you need in origami.
All of origami comes from that.
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?"
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin, and yet they govern all of chemistry, all of life, all of history.
If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things.
So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures -- and by itself it's nothing.
But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different.
This fish, 400 scales -- again, it is one uncut square, only folding.
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes.
And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.
The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
And yeah, you really can.
So how do we do that?
Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps.
So let me stretch out that equation.
I start with my idea. I abstract it.
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject.
A flap for every leg.
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape.
Now the first step: pretty easy.
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that's hard.
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump.
And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something.
But we're going to start small.
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
How would you make a single flap?
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
What paper went into that flap?
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap.
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.
I can use it for something else.
Well, there's other ways of making a flap.
There's other dimensions for flaps.
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.
If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
There's other ways of making flaps.
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
So no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper.
So now we're ready to scale up.
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
What do I need?
I need a lot of circles.
And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles.
And here's where the dead people start to help us out.
Because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles.
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements.
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules.
That gives you the folds.
Those folds fold into a base.
You shape the base.
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.
And it's so simple.
It's so simple that a computer could do it.
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
But computers, you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this we could.
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
It's free.
It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern.
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed, which you can kind of tell -- it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern.
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.
And if you want a different deer, not a white-tailed deer, you change the packing, and you can do an elk.
Or you could do a moose.
Or really, any other kind of deer.
These techniques revolutionized this art.
We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close -- things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae.
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square.
She's eating him.
I call it "Snack Time."
And you can do more than just insects.
This -- you can put details: toes and claws.
A grizzly bear has claws.
This tree frog has toes.
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.
Toes have become an origami meme.
Because everyone's doing it.
You can make multiple subjects.
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.
The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square.
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass -- that's not so hot.
Do a little more complicated instrument."
Well, then you could do an organ.
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand.
So now people can say, I want exactly this and this and this, and you can go out and fold it.
And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
But I want to show you some examples.
Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami.
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.
Computers made things move, but these were all real folded objects that we made.
And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.
Surprisingly, origami, and the structures that we've developed in origami, turn out to have applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
And I want to show you some of these examples.
One of the earliest was this pattern: this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure.
And he used it to design this solar array.
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995.
Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb space telescope, but it's very simple.
The telescope -- going up in space, it unfolds in two places.
It folds in thirds.
It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami.
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami.
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger.
They called it "The Eyeglass."
The design called for geosynchronous orbit, 26,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens.
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists who want to look up, and then other people who wanted to look down.
Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space?
You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
And rockets are small.
So you have to make it smaller.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
So you have to do something like this -- this was a small model.
For the lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.
But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.
So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, "Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."
So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size, but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.
And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.
But this is a five-meter telescope -- has about a quarter-mile focal length.
And it works perfectly on its test range, and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.
Now, there is other origami in space.
The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey.
And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body.
And this example is the latter.
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University.
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels.
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water-bomb base.
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space.
And they want to do their design by simulation.
So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag.
And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation.
And so they can do a simulation like this.
Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out: does it work?
And that leads to a really interesting idea.
You know, where did these things come from?
Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school.
It's the same pattern, called "the water-bomb base."
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs.
The thing is, that this often happens in math and science.
When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world.
And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life.
Let's start with day and night.
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
I'll give you an example.
If you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
So, we have this ability as well.
And in humans, we call it the body clock.
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing.
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
And so, in this way, we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
It's a huge driver for culture, and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe, and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on.
You enjoy your family life inside.
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active.
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?
Well, it turns out that, when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.
They go to bed around 8:00 pm.
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 am until sunrise.
And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
So, cut to the modern day.
We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.
And, you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs.
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task.
But what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that I think, if we understand, we can really move forward.
And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know.
And I'm going to start with this one.
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
And if we just take that and we build from there, then we can go to the next step, which is that if the ocean ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
That's the theme of my Talk.
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
Cannery Row, at the time, had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast.
We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water.
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work, wrote in the 1940s that, "The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black."
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell.
But you know what they came out saying?
They say, "You know what you smell?
You smell money."
That pollution was money to that community.
And those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money.
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy, and we made them unhealthy.
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages.
And I want to call that "pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now ... when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way, and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean.
Because when an ecologist looks at the ocean, we see all those interconnections.
We see the base of the food chain, the plankton the small things, and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid, and on so up this diagram.
And that flow, that flow of life, from the very base up to the very top, is the flow that ecologists see.
And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
It's that pyramid.
Now why does that matter for human health?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us, molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies.
And they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up, they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators.
And in so doing, they accumulate.
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
We don't really have to play it. We can just think about it here.
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
Imagine that when we got on this boat, we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts.
Can't do much with them but put them in your pocket.
Because the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here.
And they will accumulate in the drunkest stingiest people.
There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid.
They accumulate into the top of it.
Now suppose instead of Styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead.
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around.
And instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group.
Because they're absorbed by us.
And that's the difference between a PCB and, say, something natural like an omega-3, something we want out of the marine food chain.
PCBs accumulate.
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
They get into the food chain.
The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton, and those PCBs, being fat-soluble, accumulate in these dolphins.
Now, a dolphin, mother dolphin, any dolphin -- there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
And what's that?
In mother's milk.
Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota bay.
Adult males, a huge load.
Juveniles, a huge load.
Females after their first calf is already weaned, a lower load.
Those females, they're not trying to.
Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring.
And their offspring don't survive.
The death rate in these in these dolphins, for the first calf born of every female dolphin, is 60 to 80 percent.
These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant.
And most of them die.
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce, but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first born calf.
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
That top predator, of course, is us.
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places.
This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo -- or is it?
In fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
That's another story.
But some of them were not whale meat at all.
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs, dioxins and heavy metals.
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat.
It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
That's a tragedy for those populations.
But it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
We had these data a few years ago.
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA.
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking, "Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery."
But it was so awful.
And for the very first time in my scientific career I broke scientific protocol, which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals, and then begin to talk about them.
We sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of Japan.
Because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic.
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan.
And I'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which I believe they shouldn't.
But at least it's labeled correctly, and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead.
It isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women.
These women have toxic breast milk.
They cannot feed their offspring, their children, their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain, in their part of the world's ocean pyramid.
That means their immune systems are compromised.
It means that their children's development can be compromised.
And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women, not by changing the pyramid, but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem.
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem, but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom, can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer in the base of that pyramid, it can back up all through it.
And we end up with things we've heard about before: red tides for example, which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage.
We can also get blooms of bacteria, blooms of viruses in the ocean.
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio, which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
Why does that happen?
It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches.
Often what jams us up is sewage.
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"?
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage.
But beaches are closed a lot in our country.
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason.
And I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
It's not just a question of cleanliness.
It's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease.
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative, showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years.
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
And if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert.
That means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now.
And that makes them even more difficult.
These same infections create harmful algal blooms.
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms.
Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities, brought there, not by a normal human vector, but by a marine vector, this copepod.
Copepods are small crustaceans.
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long.
And they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease.
That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world.
So what do you do?
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well, that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged.
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
And he could come in and fix the flow.
But in fact, if you look around the world, not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems, there have been places where problems have been fixed, where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around.
Monterey is one of those.
I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems.
In 1932 that's the picture.
In 2009 the picture is dramatically different.
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
And that pyramid in Monterey, right now, because of the efforts of a lot of different people, is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last 150 years.
It didn't happen accidentally.
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this.
On the left there, Julia Platt, the mayor of my little home town in Pacific Grove.
At 74 years old, became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean.
In 1931, she produced California's first community-based marine protected area, right next to the the biggest polluting cannery because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone, the ocean needed a place to grow from, that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed.
And she wanted to provide that seed.
Other people David Packard and Julie Packard, who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift, not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay, but other places around the world.
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that, what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid.
And that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life.
It's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves terrestrial species.
But the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected.
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.
Thank you very much.
The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation.
And I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands.
And in scenic Switzerland for me.
I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.
Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.
And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom, much to the dismay of my mother.
To the dismay of my mother, this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.
And I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy. And raced a solar car across Australia.
Also the U.S. and Japan.
So, wind power, solar power, we had a lot to talk about.
We had a lot that got us excited.
So we decided to do a special project together.
To combine engineering and design and ...
Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.
And we made a baby.
Can you bring out our baby?
This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
It's got an amazing user experience.
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.
And we've only got three minutes.
But we could talk about it for hours.
Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old.
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented, satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security was destroyed by the war.
So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living.
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question.
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.
Actually I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and there was -- I didn't have money to go to a movie, but I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers he was going to talk.
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
And it -- actually, instead of talking about little green men, he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky, kind of as a -- he talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war.
And this seemed very interesting to me.
And I started reading his books after that lecture.
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.
Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand these roots of happiness.
This is a typical result that many people have presented, and there are many variations on it.
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy.
And that hasn't changed at all.
Whereas the personal income, on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation, has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.
But you find essentially the same results, namely, that after a certain basic point which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level, increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
And, in fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness.
So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience, I tried to understand now, where in everyday life, in our normal experience, do we feel really happy.
And to start that -- those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.
And the interview was 40 pages long.
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview.
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.
Now ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something.
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China, Greece, Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.
We know the temples they built so -- where people could come to experience a different reality.
We know about the circuses, the arenas, the theaters -- these are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.
We are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we're used to.
But this man doesn't need to go to there.
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks, and as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination.
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create -- like Jennifer did in her improvisation -- a new reality, that is a moment of ecstasy.
He enters that different reality.
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second.
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second.
That's why you can't hear more than two people.
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man does, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels, or his problems at home.
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
His body disappears, his identity disappears from his consciousness, because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do, to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists.
So existence is temporarily suspended.
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder, because I can't compose.
So what is that telling you here, but in other parts of the interview is that obviously this automatic, spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well-trained and who has developed technique.
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field.
Whether it's mathematics or music -- it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before.
Now, when that happens, he says the music just flows out.
And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
And it happens in different realms.
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky -- very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
But it happens in other activities.
For instance, this is another student of mine, Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world.
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person.
You don't think it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible.
You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it.
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say, you can't have just one of these things to be successful.
If you want a meaningful job and successful job -- Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.
She is the founder of Body Shop, the cosmetic, kind of natural cosmetic king.
It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working.
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka, who was, at that time, starting out Sony without any money, without a product -- they didn't have a product, they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation, be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.
I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace.
Now, when we do studies, we have, with other colleagues around the world, done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks, to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds -- who enjoy their work.
And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow.
There's this focus that once it becomes intense, leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity, you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other, you get immediate feedback.
You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger.
And once those conditions are present, what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.
And we can measure this very precisely, actually, because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day, and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel, where you are, what you're thinking about.
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skills that they feel they have at that moment.
So for each person we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram.
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill, which will be different from that of anybody else.
But you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle.
If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.
And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano, probably, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you.
And then the other areas become less and less positive.
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill.
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from, because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and that to enter -- going back to flow -- then they develop higher skills.
Control is also a good place to be, because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
It's not very challenging any more.
And if you want to enter flow from control, you have to increase the challenges.
So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into.
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal.
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.
Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative -- you don't feel that you're doing anything, you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.
The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television, the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.
And then, even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow, but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it.
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.
And that's what our mandate is in a way to do. OK.
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is, what it could be, and what your relationship to it is.
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision, an imagined future, if you will, of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it, "Once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme."
I want to start with these word pairs here.
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago, when the foundation form was actually invented, they didn't think of themsevles on the wrong side of these either.
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse.
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times.
What Rockefeller called "The business of benevolence."
But by the end of the twentieth century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about, and that's exactly what is happening, is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions.
For philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, by new pressures.
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
This report is our main public report.
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago.
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you.
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about, the Gates and the Soros and the Google.
Instead, what I want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us.
The democratization of philanthropy.
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time.
What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
Now, this may surprise you.
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked, has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way.
He said, "We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money.
Now we have Wikipedia.
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book.
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility.
WISER sets out to document, link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement and fastest growing movement in human history.
Humanity's collective immune response to today's threats.
Now, all of these big things for love experiments aren't going to take off.
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
This is, of course, to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
And this challenges yet another assumption, which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need.
Take a look at Changing the Present, started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
And it goes on and on.
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet, which I call aggregated giving.
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer.
It's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation.
There are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger.
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz, a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
But there are many others. New Profit in Cambridge, New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley, Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington, Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.
Take a look at these.
These funds are to philanthropy what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds are to investing.
But with a twist, because often a community forms around these funds, as it has at Acumen and other places.
Now, imagine for a second these first three types of experiments, mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
