For a good marriage, travel the same way to work
Shared dreams and ambitions can help make a successful relationship.
But it seems the rather less romantic link of a shared commute can also help.
Married couples are happier if they travel to work in the same direction, says a study.
Experts believe it makes couples feel they share wider goals in life.
They say the findings suggest newlyweds should consider choosing a home that requires them both to commute in one direction, rather than one located at the midway point between their two work places.
'Couples’ marital satisfaction can depend on whether they commute to work in the same or different directions,' said lead researcher Irene Huang, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
'Physically moving in a particular goal-relevant direction (e.g. commuting to work) might become associated with more general goal-related concepts.'
They quote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of The Little Prince, who said: 'Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but looking in the same direction together.'
Huang and her colleagues found a clear correlation between commuting in the same direction and higher marital satisfaction.
They also found that this link existed independent of other factors such as number of years married, number of children, income level and differences in actual time spent commuting.
Furthermore, the link did not depend on whether or not couples sometimes left home for work together, meaning it was not due to having the chance to talk together while commuting.
The second survey involved 139 married adults in Hong Kong, who were 42 years old on average and had been married for an average of 13 years.
It showed a similar correlation to the US results, which also held independent of other relevant factors.
Parsing China's conflicting economic data
You can get whiplash from reading the economic news coming out of China these days.
One month the skeptics hold up weak industrial output and exclaim, "Crash ahead!"
The next month, the bulls are back celebrating things like China's 7.7% GDP growth last year.
The latest sign of China's economic to-and-fro was the recent stock selloff.
Chinese shares dropped by 15% over the last couple months, doubling the decline of other emerging market shares, in what seemed like a panic signal from traders worried about China's ability to weather upcoming obstacles, including tightening runaway credit and undergoing a massive pivot away from huge infrastructure projects to more sustainable economic growth.
The reports have been back-and-forth for the past six months, but overall they hint at some dark clouds ahead.
Here, then, is a breakdown of the indicators' recent history, where the economy is now, and where it could be headed.
Six months ago, China's Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, a key gauge of the economy's strength, was hitting 16-month highs.
The economy looked to be stabilizing after a couple disappointing quarters.
The PMI news boosted confidence that the country's new leadership in President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang could tackle rampant shadow banking and banks' excess-lending without killing growth.
The chief concern back then seemed to be how much the Fed's cutback in bond purchases, or tapering, would hurt China's economy.
The good spirits were followed by skyrocketing housing prices through the end of last year.
Prices rose nearly 30% year over year in December in Beijing and Guangzhou.
At the same time, prices in some of the country's smaller third- and fourth-tier cities fell.
There's now a break in the market: China's most affluent cities are still booming while smaller ones are starting to falter.
"If they continue to drop, that will mean banks will have more nonperforming loans, and they will have to further contract lending," says Ran Tao, Acting Director at Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing and professor of economics at Renmin University.
"Finally, if there's a credit crunch, the housing bubble may burst."
That could start in the smaller cities, and then make its way to the bigger ones.
Rising real estate prices can be healthy for any economy, but in China they're rising so fast that the odds of a crash are growing with them.
In January, an unnamed source -- most likely the government -- bailed out a $500-million risky bank investment called Credit Equals Gold No. 1.
While China averted the first default in its trust industry-- an industry that last measured around $1.6 trillion in size and is tailored for rich people searching for high-interest investments -- the news wasn't encouraging.
What does it say about other bad bets lurking in the shadows?
Was this reminiscent of two Bear Stearns hedge funds blowing up in mid-2007, which intimated problems elsewhere in the financial system?
In the beginning of February, China's PMI fell to 50.5, a six-month low (above 50 signals growth).
The numbers came just after the news that China posted still-impressive 7.7% GDP growth in 2013.
The PMI number was scary because it portended a potential deep slowdown as the country tightens credit and shifts away from a reliance on exports.
Everyone knows China eventually needs to shift its economy, but that process won't necessarily be smooth.
The falling PMI was a reminder of that.
And about that emerging markets selloff the past couple months: Deutsche Bank took a closer look at the figures and found something revealing.
The analysts focused on the difference between the stock performance of China's H share index and A share index -- the difference being that H shares are listed in Hong Kong and widely held by global investors, whereas A shares are listed in the mainland and not open to foreigners.
What they found was that during the two months leading to mid-February, the A share index fell only 6% while the H shares dropped 16%.
They concluded that the stock market wasn't punishing China, but throwing it out with all the other emerging markets.
They wrote, "The only meaningful explanation for the 10% under performance of the H share index is the indiscriminate selling of emerging market equities by global investors."
The stock market offers some optimism for the Chinese economy facing plenty of other ups and downs.
6 Tips for Expanding Your Social Circles
Whether you’re interested in advancing your career, or having a new group of friends to go out with, you need to learn—and perhaps master—the skill of making friends.
In this article, I would like to share with you 6 tips that will help you expand your social circles.
Connect With Connectors
A great way to expand your social circle is to connect to someone through whom you’ll meet many other people.
Those “connectors” are the types of people who keep friends on Facebook by the thousands, host parties whenever they can, and always seem to be with a large group of people.
Oftentimes, these are very open people and are easier to connect with than you think.
They might not have the time to invest in a deep friendship with you, but they love to get to know more interesting people to add to their circle.
Meet New People Constantly
A great habit to have is to always be meeting people that you can add to your circles.
In reality, not all the people you meet will become your friends and not all your current friends will be around forever.
This is why I always say that if you’re not making new friends, you’re actually making fewer.
I recommend that you go to places where it’s easy and appropriate to walk up to anyone and introduce yourself.
Ideally, you need to go to places where others are open to meeting new people as well. Examples might be trade shows, opening nights, galas, cultural or charitable events, seminars, and talks.
Establish Yourself As a Giver of Value
When meeting lots of people, you have to “hook”.
Nothing hooks better than having a giver attitude.
First, listen really to what they say and imagine if you were them; see the world through their eyes.
Second, be willing to share stories, contacts, or quick advice on what people are talking about.
When you meet new people, there are some psychological principles that determine whether or not they’ll want to meet you again.
This works on an unconscious level.
One of the most important principles is the giver/takerattitude.
If they sense that you only care about yourself, connection isn’t going to happen.
You can portray a giver attitude in two ways.
The first is about really listening to what they say, imagining the world through their eyes, and giving them your opinion on their stories and situations.
The second way is to prove that you’re ready to share similar stories about what they’re talking about, or introduce them to someone who could help them.
Commit to a Local Community
One of the fastest ways to boost your social life is to get involved in a community that has the type of people that you want as friends.
This community should be in your local area and should hold social get-togethers once a month, or more.
What you do is find one that you like, maybe on meetup.com, and offer your help to the people who run it.
They’ll most likely accept, even if they don’t need that much help; they’ll just be glad you’re interested.
This works great because it makes you meet everyone, and because it establishes you as a giver of value.
Reach Out to People On a Regular Basis
Staying in touch is vital if you want to keep your social circles alive.
You need to follow up with the people you just met, and catch up with existing friends.
The challenge here is that we tend to get distracted and forget about it, and regret later on.
To solve this problem, you can create a weekly ritual, where you spend only one hour calling, texting, and messaging people.
Just mark on your calendar a specific day and time, and do it every week.
A great time to do it is Tuesday or Wednesday, as it gives you the opportunity to make plans with people for the weekend.
Know the Kind of Friends You Want in Advance
Before you start investing more time on making friends, do a little planning.
Try to figure out what kind of people you want to hang out with.
List out a few qualities, character traits, or interests that you like, and don’t hesitate to be a little more ambitious than usual.
This is important because it allows your mind to quickly tell if a person you meet could be a great fit for you.
5 Realistic Reasons Why Women Cheat
As far as stereotypes go, a wandering eye and the urge to jump into bed with multiple partners seems to be built into a man's DNA, but when it comes to cheating, the sexes are created more equally than we think.
(Cough, Kristen Stewart, cough.) Renee Lee, a relationship expert with a masters in psychology, dishes out five reasons why women cheat.
Going Through A Transition
"If it is graduating, turning a certain age, losing a parent or advancing the relationship status, women become introspective," explains Lee. "Even if it is something she wants, such as just getting engaged or graduating, the transition can stir up an array of emotions about where her life is going or where she is in it. The discomfort of change can trigger an impulsive desire to find someone to take her focus off the change and be a diversion for what she is going through."
2. Not Feeling Adequately Celebrated
We've all been here: "May it be getting a promotion, organizing a fundraiser, or making Thanksgiving dinner for a party of 20, men often make the misstep of "not complimenting their partner's achievements," Lee says.
"Women seek an emotional connection that their partner notices them, is proud of their achievements, and appreciates what they do, so when they aren't getting this at home the residual effects lead to feelings of frustration, dissatisfaction, depression, and restlessness."
And that's when they could go looking for it elsewhere.
"When you are living in the day to day with someone, it is challenging to step outside a situation and notice the things that do matter to someone," adds Lee "As this wears down over time, so as soon as the woman encounters someone who ignites the spark they are lacking at home, they equate it to an emotional connection and seek companionship with someone else."
3. Feeling A Relationship Ending
"When a woman feels that uneasy sense that a relationship is on the outs, by either her doing or his, she will often look to fill the void externally to soften the blow," Lee reasons for a woman's infidelity. "If she is the one considering the breakup, she may be using this tactic as a challenge to herself both testing the waters, and then gauge if she can go through with it."
4. It's Just Not Fun Anymore
...But it's too hard to pull the plug.
"When you don't laugh, you don't love. Laughter is one of the key elements in a relationship that often gets overlooked," Lee explains, simply.
"When stresses of day to day life become the dominant factor in a relationship, women feel unhappy. When they come across a coworker, or friend that they have a good time with, it suddenly brings to light what is missing in their own relationship and becomes tempting to act upon."
5. It's Boring In The Bedroom
Men aren't the only ones who need to spice things up.
"Women need to feel desired!" Lee declares.
If she is not getting any, enough, or nothing to talk about, women start to feel a sexual void.
With the popularity of books such as Fifty Shades of Grey, television shows, or listening to friends talk about their fun single trysts, women have that moment when they compare their love life at home to what the rest of the world seems to be experiencing." And that's when she may start to wonder what she's missing.
"Though it is easy to pinpoint the flaws in one's sex life, it is often hard to make the changes needed to correct them," adds Lee. "This creates a temptation in women to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere with someone they don't have the baggage with and can be more uninhibited."
Now you know why women cheat.
But we say, if you're thinking about cheating, just break up with the guy, before you move on to a new one.
Y Combinator's Paul Graham: Get a co-founder
Paul Graham has touched a lot of startups.
Not in the sappy, sentimental way -- though some founders may largely credit him for their success -- but where influence is concerned.
Because few in the Valley can claim they have interacted with, advised, and funded as many early-stage businesses as Graham has.
Indeed, Y Combinator, the startup incubator he co-founded with wife Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell, and Robert Tappan Morris, has seen 632 startups come and go since 2005, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and online payments platform Stripe.
Last week, Graham announced he was stepping down as Y Combinator President, handing the reins off to partner Sam Altman.
In doing so, Graham will still offer advice part-time to YC startups but cease day-to-day administrative tasks like poring over applications and interviewing applicants.
"I spend all the time on that crap," Graham half-joked onstage at this year's LAUNCH Festival in San Francisco.
Graham also offered some parting general startup advice, culled from nine years of running YC.
Get a co-founder ...
Businesses are more likely to succeed with more than one founder, because each co-founder may bring different strengths.
Graham used Apple (AAPL) as an easy example: Steve Jobs was a pro with sales while the tech-focused Steve Wozniak couldn't have cared less.
That's why Graham usually tells YC applicants to get a co-founder.
In fact, that's exactly the advice he offered Dropbox CEO Drew Houston when he applied for YC in 2007.
Houston supposedly did just that, recruiting MIT classmate Arash Ferdowsi in two weeks.
Now, seven years later, Dropbox has raised $350 million in its latest round with a valuation of $10 billion, far less than the amount Graham recalls Houston would have been willing to sell Dropbox for in the early YC days.
"The answer was definitely under $10 million -- it might have been under a $1 million or $2 million," he recalled.
But get a co-founder you actually like ...
Basic? Sure.
But you'd be surprised how many startup founders actually don't gel.
With YC's three most successful startups -- Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe -- much of Graham and crew's acceptance decision was based on the co-founders themselves and how well they got along. (Of course, a promising idea didn't hurt.)
And if they don't?
Well, that's easy to tell quickly enough, even during a YC interview, which spans a pithy eight to 10 minutes.
"One guy literally rolled his eyes when his co-founder was talking and pitching us -- a surefire tell," Graham said.
Focus on a specific subset of users ...
Longtime startup investors usually have one startup that had a nifty idea but never quite took off.
For Graham, it's Etherpad.
Released in November 2008 by Appjet, Graham accepted the startup into YCombinator because he "liked the idea so much."
Essentially, Etherpad was a Google Docs (GOOG) competitor: a feature-rich, web-based text editor that let multiple users collaborate, write, and edit documents in real-time. (Google acquired the software in late 2009.)
Problem was, the product lacked focus.
"They should have launched it as one thing and let people realize, 'Hey this is much more than real-time typing,'" Graham offered.
Instead of a catch-all approach, Graham said the secret to growth is starting a "small, intense fire" -- first focus on a subset of users and meet their needs.
Again, Graham brought up Apple as an example: The company produced just 200 units of its first personal computer, the Apple I, but sold 175 of them within the first 10 months on sale, largely to computer hobbyists.
Explained Graham: "You've got to know who those first users are, sit with them, have a party, and focus on them."
Why foreign leaders love Silicon Valley
Foreign leaders visiting the United States can fill their itineraries from a long list of fabulous destinations to conduct international diplomacy.
Scenic mountains, balmy beaches, and a certain city that never sleeps would seem like top contenders.
But instead, presidents and prime ministers from around the world are flocking to Silicon Valley, the land of office parks and suburban sprawl.
Getting to know top executives from Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), it turns out, is almost as important as photo-ops and meetings in Washington, D.C.
Last week, French President François Hollande became the latest such figure to make a pilgrimage to the world's technology capital.
In the last few years, leaders from Israel, Ireland, New Zealand, Turkey, Russia, Netherlands, Lithuania, and Malaysia have also visited.
Their interest reflects the growing muscle of Silicon Valley companies and venture capitalists, with which heads of state are trying to curry favor in hopes of attracting business, investment, and any political cachet that comes from championing innovation.
"They're looking for jobs," said William Miller, a former provost at Stanford University who accompanied a number of foreign delegations in Silicon Valley over the years. "They also have a feeling that a larger company -- whether Intel or Google -- could locate there and become a magnet for others."
During his brief visit, Hollande met with dozens of top Silicon Valley executives.
A private lunch included Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman; Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook; and Twitter (TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey.
In addition, Hollande opened a new technology incubator in San Francisco for French startups, which aren't exactly taking the world by storm from home.
Incubators devoted to just one country, which are often sponsored by foreign governments, have fast become a Silicon Valley fixture.
Israel, Ireland, Denmark, Germany, and Australia are among those with beachheads that support young companies and help with access to U.S. investors and partners.
The playbook followed by foreign leaders is well-established.
Get off the plane in San Francisco, hold a few events to highlight their enthusiasm for all things tech, then mingle with a few well-known tech executives over a gourmet lunch or at a town hall meeting.
In 2012, Shimon Peres, Israel's president, made the trip to Facebook's headquarters during a four-day tour of Silicon Valley to promote Israeli startups.
During an interview on stage with Sandberg, he described himself as a fan of social networking.
People can use it, he said, to work around governments and achieve peace on their own -- although peace in the Middle East seems to be just as elusive now as ever.
Last year, Haiti's prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, made a rare trifecta by visiting the headquarters of Facebook, Google, and Apple in one stateside trip.
It was an opportunity to ask wealthy technology companies to help his impoverished country, which is reeling from a devastating earthquake, with jobs and aid.
The companies donated free servers and some premium online tools.
But few Haitians have online connections at home, and pledges were small compared to the country's myriad problems.
Like many heads of state that visit Silicon Valley, Hollande was trying to send a message back home that he supports innovation and is working to turn France into a "startup republic."
But many French entrepreneurs accuse Hollande of undermining them with a new law that sets the top tax rate at 75%.
Avoiding the tax issue in public comments, Hollande threw out a welcome mat for American investment in French companies.
Of all the American investment in French companies, one-third comes from California, he pointed out.
"In California, you want to change the world, and it's a beautiful mission -- a very ambitious mission, but one we really understand because we have the same vision," he said in a speech at San Francisco's City Hall.
For centuries, France wanted to change the world, and together we can change the world.
We can change the way we consume, we produce -- the way we deal with health or technology in order to make the world a better place.
Usually, foreign leaders steer clear of the differences they have with the technology companies they're courting.
No need to inflame tensions, after all, over issues like privacy, human rights, and regulations.
Hollande's government is probing whether technology companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn (LNKD) illegally dodged taxes.
Moreover, France recently punished Google for privacy violations by requiring it to post an embarrassing notice about its misdeeds on its home page for 48 hours.
Google did not respond to requests for comment about Hollande's visit or his government or targeting it with investigations.
Facebook would only give a vague statement along the lines of, "Let's all work together."
"We welcomed the opportunity to meet with President Hollande and some members of his government for an open discussion about France and its role in fostering innovation and attracting foreign investment," Facebook said.
The phenomenon of foreign leaders flocking to Silicon Valley isn't entirely new.
François Mitterand, another French president, toured Silicon Valley in 1984, during which his wife Danielle, peppered Steve Jobs with uncomfortable questions about worker welfare like overtime pay and vacations rather than gushing about the technology, according to Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography of Jobs.
Before Silicon Valley's rise, foreign leaders visited factories in the Rust Belt.
Now, it's the same idea, just a different growth industry.
Silicon Valley leaders reciprocate some of the attention they receive.
When they go abroad, they often find a warm reception.
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a trip to Japan in 2012.
And last year, both he and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, met with South Korea's President Park Geun-hye.
Meetings aren't always courtesy calls. In some cases, some real business-diplomacy is done.
Last year, in a joint meeting in Paris with Hollande, Google's Schmidt signed an agreement in which the company pledged to pay $80 million to help French media companies build their presence online.
The deal settled a dispute in which French news outlets accused Google of stealing their content by showing snippets of their work in search results.
What do Silicon Valley leaders get in return?
Plenty.
Friends in high places can only help when it comes time for their governments to draft regulations about intellectual property, immigration, and permitting, for example.
Actual business deals are few and far between, at least in the short term.
But the meetings can sometimes get the ball rolling.
"There's a sense that if the rest of the world is doing better, we'll do better," Miller, the former Stanford provost, said of the CEO mindset. "It's not competition but cooperation. Product innovation doesn't just occur in one place anymore."
Is there a suicide contagion on Wall Street?
A few days ago, a Wall Street executive was debating whether he could get away from the office long enough to see his shrink uptown.
In the midst of a busy workday, it was looking unlikely.
Then he stumbled across an article in the New York Post with the disquieting news that a J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) employee had jumped to his death from the bank's offices in Hong Kong, just three weeks after a fellow banker at the firm had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the bank's London headquarters.
"JPMorgan suicide is 3rd mysterious death in weeks," read the Post headline.
The executive went to his appointment.
"He said, 'That's what drove me into your office today, I want to make sure that I'm all right,'" says Alden Cass, the psychologist who treats the executive, as well as a bunch of clients who are portfolio managers, investment bankers, and traders of all types.
The rash of suicides has sent a shudder through Wall Street and beyond.
The third death referenced by the Post—that of a J.P. Morgan executive director who died inside his Connecticut home in January—did not appear to be intentional. (A report is still pending.)
Yet the J.P. Morgan incidents are only the most recent in a string of at least a half-dozen suicides in the financial world since late August.
Those include executives at Zurich Insurance Group (ZURVY), Deutsche Bank (DB), and Russell Investments, among other firms.
Banker suicides aren't a new phenomenon.
Clusters of them in quick succession occurred during the Great Depression and during the recent Great Recession.
Indeed, research has shown that suicides can be contagious, so to speak.
That is particularly true when graphic and sensational reports of the fatalities lead to copycats, according to the American Association of Suicidology.
So the recent untimely deaths have sparked concerns that there could be more on the way.
J.P. Morgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti says the company has sent notices reminding employees that 24/7 mental health-related support resources are available at the bank, and that its hearts go out to the families of the deceased.
But with each new wave of suicides come questions about whether the deaths signify a disturbing trend: Is finance a potentially deadly occupation?
That is, do bankers kill themselves more often than other people?
To find out, Fortune asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to pull the latest suicide statistics from its National Occupational Mortality Surveillance database.
During 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2007—the most recent years during which research was funded and for which data is available—there were 329 suicides among financial specialists, more than in any other occupation tracked by the CDC except for the broad grouping of "engineers and scientists," a cohort that lost 502 to suicide.
Finance, however, is a vast profession, and while the total number of finance professionals who commit suicide may be larger than for some other professions, they are actually less likely to do so than, say, lawyers or firefighters.
Take J.P. Morgan as an example: At a bank with more than 260,000 employees around the globe, a pair of suicides may seem shocking and random but the figure is, in fact, well within the range of statistical probability.
Two might even be a low number.
"You would expect that when people work these long hours," says Alexandra Michel, a former Goldman Sachs (GS) investment banker turned management professor at the University of Pennsylvania who for 12 years has been tracking the performance and health of a group of Wall Street recruits at two banks (she can't say which) in an ongoing study. "You would think that it would happen much more often."
A close examination of the CDC data does reveal a worrisome connection between certain types of financial jobs and an elevated risk of suicide.
The CDC organizes its mortality numbers by census categories, which can be pretty broad.
The Wall Street-oriented classification is "sales representatives for financial and business services"—a category that includes a variety of banking positions, ranging from investment advisers to brokers to traders to investment bankers.
People in that group are 39% more likely to kill themselves than the workforce as a whole. (Members of some other white-collar professions are at even greater risk: Lawyers are 54% more likely than average to commit suicide, and physicians are 97% more likely.)
Within finance, observers say that investment bankers are often under the most acute mental stress.
"Out of all the sections of finance, no position do I know of that's more extreme in terms of the emotional endurance one has to have than investment banking," says Cass, the psychologist who is also the co-author of Bullish Thinking: The Advisor's Guide to Surviving and Thriving on Wall Street.
It's a syndrome Michel has also observed while shadowing investment bankers over the years.
After her subjects had worked at a bank for four years on average, she began observing signs of sleeplessness, anxiety, and depression:
"I could see how people came in chatting happily on the phone with friends, how that became less and less," she says. "People became completely absorbed in the office, in work. Some are feeling trapped."
J.P. Morgan says the two employees who committed suicide weren't investment bankers, per se.
According to their LinkedIn (LNKD) profiles, Gabriel Magee was a vice president overseeing technology for fixed-income securities in the London office, and Dennis Li was an associate in the billing department supporting the investment bank.
But the high-stakes world of Wall Street has become a more stressful work environment across the board.
The 2008 economic crisis and subsequent recession have exacerbated the problem, says Cass, especially now that the new reality of smaller bonus checks, regular layoffs, and heightened regulation has sunk in.
While those factors have impacted many professions, Cass says, "In investment banking, it becomes a weed-out process—who can take it and who can't?"
Cass has noticed the scrutiny weighing on his clients.
The anxiety has trickled down from bosses and pervaded the culture, he says, with bankers kept in a "fear position," worrying constantly about keeping their jobs—or worse, facing criminal charges.
A CDC analysis of suicides by occupation for 2008 and beyond won't be ready until 2015.
But the government agency recently reported an alarming increase in suicides between 1999 and 2010 among Americans old enough to be at the peak of their careers or well-established in the C-suite.
Suicides among 35- to 64-year-olds rose 28%, with even larger increases among white people (40%) and those over 50 (more than 48%).
While it's not fair, warns Cass, to point blame at any one firm or the industry itself, he sees the increased pressure to avoid mistakes as taking its toll on bankers.
"Obviously it's good for the collective health of our financial security in the long run," he says.
For the near term, his clients are keeping their appointments.
The secrets to winning an Academy Award
If the Oscars seem boring and predictable to you this year, then you're in good company.
Sociologists have considered the Academy Awards predictable for a long time.
A few weeks ago, I spoke with Gabriel Rossman, a UCLA sociologist with some of the most interesting research on the intersection of economics and pop culture.
Rossman has two fascinating papers about the Oscars.
The first addressed the tantalizing question: What qualities of a movie best predict Oscars nominations?
Unsurprisingly, the biggest correlation was being in a very serious movie.
Considering 172,000 performances listed on IMDB in 20,000 movies, Rossman and co-author Nicole Esparza found that dramas were were nine times more likely to get nominations.
The second and third best predictors both had to do with the size of the competition.
When there are fewer films released around awards season, the odds that any one movie gets a nomination increases.
This simple principle applies, rather unfortunately, to actresses, as well.
It's an industry truism, borne out in the evidence, that women have fewer meaty roles in the types of movies likely to be nominated for an Oscar.
That means any one dramatic end-of-year performance by a woman has a higher chance of earning a nomination.
Perhaps the most substantive finding in the paper is that people with high IMDB movie rankings in past movie credits were more likely to work with other stars, doubling their chances at getting a nomination.
“Actors are going to look good when they work with talented people," Rossman told the Daily Bruin. "This is an interesting thing since you tend to get talented people working with other talented people, meaning that people will end up looking even better than when just working alone.”
Maybe this seems completely obvious to you: Better actors get better parts and then get to work with better directors (hello, Leonardo DiCaprio).
But it's also a classic example of what sociologists call cumulative advantage or the "Matthew Effect," named after the passage in Matthew where Jesus says "For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich."
This isn't as simple as the rich getting richer.
It's the idea that slightly more talented people get access to higher-quality support for their talents, which greatly multiplies the benefits of their innate advantage (e.g.: smarter students going to colleges with better professors and better career services connections).
The fact that movies with stars get more Oscar attention might be an indication that Hollywood's stars are simply better than its non-stars.
But probably not.
It's much more likely a sign that (just as you might have suspected) we're bad picking out discrete instances of talent in star-studded projects.
This would imply we—or, at least, the Academy—is just as bad at recognizing Oscar-worthy talentin movies without any past Oscar nominees.
In both cases, the context overwhelms our ability to recognize individual achievement.
Rossman's second Oscar paper is about audiences and prizes. Some producers really want to win Oscars.
These producers would also, presumably, like to make money.
The problem is that audiences don't like most movies that are "Academy Award movies"—here defined as late-year releases about serious subjects (like AIDS, slavery, or technological dystopia)—so the business of making an Oscar-y movie is high-risk with dubiously high reward.
Rossman explains it well:
It turns out that audiences dislike movies that are *trying* to get Oscar nominations but really like movies that actually *get* Oscar nominations.
By inference, if there were no Oscars to drive box office towards them, there would be far fewer movies about historical protagonists overcoming oppression.
Indeed, it looks like Hollywood basically nails it since they make exactly the right number of Oscar-targeted movies that the two effects balance out on average.
To the victors go the spoils, kind of.
Best Picture winners can expect a 22 percentraise in box office after a nomination and another 15 percent bump if they win, according to IBISWorld.
But the financial calculations probably miss the best reasons to try to make an Oscar movie: To win accolades within the industry, to win access to stars who can make you more money down the line and, just maybe, to bask in the honor of making a truly great film.
Screens put years on you: 'Computer face' is giving women jowls and lines
A growing number of women are developing something called 'computer face', a leading cosmetic surgeon said.
Dr Michael Prager said professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls, 'turkey neck' and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
The Botox specialist said that, of all his clientele, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.
'If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown or squint while they are concentrating at the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,' Dr Prager, 42, said.
'What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.
'If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.
'We are seeing a lot of women who work in executive jobs in offices who have this problem.' Dr Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.
'When people are stressed or thinking hard about something then they will often put on a "grumpy face" without even knowing what they are doing. When my clients put a mirror next to their desk they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.'
He warned that a generation of younger men and women who had grown up with information technology were developing 'computer face' at a much earlier age.
He said: 'The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so. But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.
'It will be completely different for them and I think the problem is going to become much, much worse. In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.'
Dr Prager said there were several simple steps which could stave off computer face such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles.
And, of course, there was always Botox.
He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of 'grumpy face' could be broken.

What singles really what
A recent online commercial tells the following story: upon graduating, getting a job and being promoted, the female protagonist’s grandmother, whose health is in decline, keeps asking her the same question, “When are you getting married?”, until the woman finally rushes home in a wedding dress to bring the elderly lady in her dying days the ultimate comfort.
Marriage puts a lot of pressure on single women, as if they are destined to get married in order to fulfill others’, rather than their own, expectations.
But what’s pushing single women into matrimony is a social stereotype and form of self-identification that creates a dilemma for modern women in today’s social contexts, experts say.
In the book Seeking Happily Ever After: Navigating the Ups and Downs of Being Single Without Losing Your Mind (and Finding Lasting Love Along the Way), US author Michelle Cove tries to reveal what women really want out of a relationship.
As reported in Marie Claire, a women’s magazine in the US, Cove identifies some of the categories of single women based on intensive interviews.
The Soul-Mate Seeker
Finding “The One” is the most important task in her life.
The Phoenix
She is doing everything she can to rise from a recent devastating breakup and to be in good shape again.
The Organic
She prefers the “let it be” approach and leaves things up to destiny.
She lives her own life rather than hunting for men in a methodical way.
The Free Spirit
Independence or a relationship?
She believes there is no way to reach a compromise between both and therefore leans to the former.
The Wedding Wisher
She suddenly finds herself fantasizing about getting married after a lifetime of not caring about it.
The Town Rebel
She no longer aspires to live the normal lifestyle of everyone else in her community, though she once used to.
The Slow and Steady
A woman who hopes to marry when the time is right.
Meanwhile, she does her best not to cave to the massive pressure she feels from friends, family and society.
The Trailblazer
A woman who knows married life is not for her, so she’s trying to break a new kind of path to happiness.
Welcome to As It Is from VOA Learning English! I'm Mario Ritter in Washington.
Today we turn to South Asia and the issue of public health.
Vaccination efforts have almost ended the risk of polio infection in most countries.
But the World Health Organization says the virus is still a problem in a major Pakistani city.
The World Health Organization has declared the Pakistani city of Peshawar, the world's "largest reservoir" of endemic poliovirus.
And WHO officials fear Pakistanis could face travel restrictions unless steps are taken immediately to stop the disease from spreading.Christopher Cruise has more.
Researchers studied all the cases of poliomyelitis in Pakistan last year.
The researchers found that almost every case could be linked genetically to the poliovirus often reported in Peshawar.
They added that all test samples collected from different parts of the city have shown the presence of the highly infectious virus.
Polio mainly affects children under five years of age. The virus is passed through food or water.
The virus reproduces in the body, and later invades the nervous system.
The disease can sometimes lead to paralysis, with loss of muscle control in part of the body.
The WHO study found that 90 percent of Pakistan's polio cases could be linked to the virus in Peshawar.
In addition, 12 of the 13 polio cases in Afghanistan were also linked to the city.
Elias Durry serves as the WHO's emergency coordinator for polio in Pakistan.
He says local officials need to take urgent action to strengthen vaccination campaigns.
He says the situation in Peshawar not only threatens the gains Pakistan has made against polio,
but could also harm international efforts to stop the disease.
"Unless the polio eradication program in Pakistan is able to curtail the transmission in Peshawar,
the expansion of, of the viruses to other places will not stop,
so it is critical that Peshawar, the way it is behaving now, really be able to find ways of interrupting these transmissions that have been consistent throughout the years."
He also noted an increase in deadly attacks on vaccination campaign workers in and around Peshawar, and in other areas.
Taliban militants often attack polio workers in Pakistan.
The militants accuse them of being American spies or part of a plot to keep Muslims from having babies.
Most of the attacks have taken place in Peshawar because the city is close to the country's tribal districts.
Extremist groups have bases in those areas.
Elias Durry did not reject the possibility of other countries ordering travel and visa restrictions on Pakistan if there is no quick improvement in the situation.
In neighboring India, no polio cases have been reported for the past three years.
Starting this month, all visitors to India from Pakistan are required to show a record of their polio vaccination.I'm Christopher Cruise.

Police in Guizhou province say they have established a motive for Thursday's deadly bus arson that killed six people.
They say the suspect, surnamed Su, believed his wife was having an affair,
and thus he "took revenge on society" by igniting a barrel of gasoline on the bus.
A four month old boy is among the six people killed.
35 others were injured.
Survivors say the flames spread quickly.
The suspect was slightly injured in the fire - he was formally arrested on Friday.
The Chinese government has taken a major step to improve the competitiveness of the nation's oil and gas exploration sector.
A variety of equipment vital to the industry has been added to China's duty-free list,
including drilling equipment, semi-submersible drilling rigs, liquified natural gas carriers,
and several other pieces vital to exploration and high-end manufactoring.
The measure takes effect on Saturday.
You're only a day away from Friday.
You're watching CNN STUDENT NEWS.
You're ten minutes away from getting up to speed on current events.
We are starting in China today.
Big meeting there.
It's the once a year gathering of the National People's Congress.
It includes thousands of delegates from all over the country.
China is a communist state.
The government controls the economy and other parts of society.
It won't be voting on any major laws.
But this meeting is a chance for China to talk about its economic plans.
And because it's the world's second largest economy, international economists are watching to see what China will do.
Other parts of the international community are watching Ukraine.
A lot of talking about the crisis there yesterday.
Meetings involving officials from the European Union, Ukraine, Russia, the U.S., but there wasn't a lot of action.
Some U.S. officials are still considering economic sanctions against Russian for its involvement in Ukraine.
Russia's threatening economic action of its own that could hurt trade in other parts of Europe.
You didn't see it, you didn't feel it.
You might not have known it was there.
But an asteroid zipped by us yesterday.
Well, that's relative.
It was close by space standards, it wasn't in terms of miles.
But since there is a one in 10,000 chance of this same asteroid coming back near us, on March 4, 2046, Chad Myers is going to help us get to know it.
Chad.
Hey, Carl, an asteroid yesterday flew between the Earth and the Moon, or at least the orbit of the Moon.
It's about a quarter of a million miles between the Earth to the Moon.
And this was slightly inside of it.
90 percent, all the way from here to here, or ten percent from here to here.
So, it was still about 217,000 miles away as it flew on by the Earth.
Now, let's think about the size of this.
Because here's the baseball diamond right here.
Here's actually the tournament field.
If you take a ball of-a big rock and you put it right over the infield, that's how big this asteroid was.
Right over the infield of any baseball diamond.
Now, you take that, you fly that in between the Earth and the Moon.
And you have something going for it.
Now, this is not one of the closer ones probably will have this year.
But it certainly is 90 percent of the way between the Earth and the Moon, and it's called DX-110.
110 because it's actually the hundred and tenth asteroid that they have found so far this year.
Dental X-rays
Little and not often, please
Confirmation that dental X-rays can be bad for you
If you are a suspicious type you may be disturbed by the fact that, despite reassurances of the safety of the procedure, dentists and their technicians, when administering X-rays, usually step out of the room while the deed is done.
Not only that, they often drape a lead-lined apron over your body to protect your vital organs. Well, all but one: your brain.
A study by Elizabeth Claus, of Yale University, just published in Cancer, suggests your suspicions might be justified.
Dr Claus thinks she has identified, in those who have had dental X-rays often, a significant rise in the admittedly small risk of developing a brain tumour.
In rich countries, five men in every 200,000, and twice as many women, develop tumours called meningiomas that affect the membranes surrounding the brain.
Meningiomas account for a third of primary brain tumours.
Only about 2% of them are malignant, but non-malignant does not mean non-dangerous.
Even a benign meningioma can kill.
Around 30% do so within five years of diagnosis.
Symptoms can include seizures and blindness, and treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy or, ironically, radiotherapy.
Ironically, because past research studying the after-effects of exposure to things like atom bombs and radiation treatments for cancer suggests the most important environmental risk factor for meningiomas is ionising radiation.
These days, however, the main source of ionising radiation for most people is neither fallout from bombs nor radiotherapy; it is dental X-rays.
Despite that, surprisingly little research has been done on those X-rays' effects.
Dr Claus and her colleagues have tried to plug the gap.
They studied 1,433 Americans who have had meningiomas and compared them with 1,350 others who have not.
These others were chosen to match the study group's age profile, sex ratio and dwelling place.
The researchers then inquired about both groups' family, medical and dental histories.
In the case of their dental histories, participants were asked whether they generally had standard X-rays, known as bitewings, every year, or never had them, or fell somewhere in between.
They were also asked how often they had had panoramic X-rays—so-called panorexes—taken of their entire mouths, and whether they had ever had braces, the fitting of which often involves a panoramic X-ray.
The researchers found that people who had had a meningioma were more than twice as likely as those who had not to have had at least one bitewing X-ray.
And the more bitewings they had been given, the greater that likelihood was.
Even more troubling was the finding that people who had been given a panorex when they were under ten had 4.9 times the normal risk of developing a meningioma.
To be fair, only 22 participants in the study had both had a panorex and developed such a tumour.
But according to Dr Claus, the panorex was not common when most of the people in the study had been children.
Nowadays, she says, before getting braces all the kids have it.
What these results mean in practice is debatable.
The radiation dose from an individual dental X-ray, Dr Claus points out, has gone down by about half over the past 30 years or so.
In addition, some dentists and orthodontists—though far from the majority—have turned to digital methods that expose patients to even lower levels. But others are using fancy new techniques like cone-beam computerised tomography which actually expose people to much higher levels of radiation.
Moreover, guidelines from the American Dental Association state that healthy adults should have a bitewing X-ray no more than once every two or three years, and that there is little reason to X-ray patients who do not have symptoms.
These are policies which Dr Claus describes as quite reasonable.
But if what her participants told her is true, not all dentists are heeding their own professional body's advice.
Most of those who took part in the study reported having at least one X-ray a year.
Dr Claus's work, then, is a timely reminder that X-rays are dangerous, that dentists should use them sparingly and that patients who have suspicions about their use are not necessarily paranoid.
A flat world sounds like something from the dark ages.
Indeed, a world of flat oil prices could, for some, be a very unpleasant place.
The lack of upward movement has already had an impact on the behaviour of major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Oman and Bahrain.
These nations have slowed the pace of budgetary expansion from a regional average of 14 per cent growth last year to less than 3 per cent this year.
A report from Moody's calculates the Brent crude oil price required to generate the revenue needed to cover spending plans (the break-even price).
Since 2008 spending has more than kept pace with a doubling oil price.
And those spending plans are still rising, even if the oil price is not.
The UN forecasts that the labour force in the region will grow at 10 per cent annually until 2020.
Investment in job creation is crucial.
Significant spending cuts will be hard to push through.
For example, the break-even price for Oman is $100; for Bahrain it is $130. Oil is trading at $109.
Should oil prices and regional government revenues suddenly drop, most of the Gulf nations can fall back on their sovereign wealth funds.
Its SWF amounts to just two years of spending.
In Bahrain oil accounts for only a quarter of its GDP but it is 87 per cent of revenues.
It is the only Gulf economy running a budget deficit, as Bank of America points out.
Since 2008 its debt to GDP ratio has more than doubled, to 61 per cent.
For now, oil is firm.
MSCI's index of Gulf country stock exchanges has risen by a tenth this year, partly on inflows into Qatar and UAE before their entry into MSCIﾒs Emerging Markets Index.
Credit default swaps on Bahrain, a potential warning indicator, have pulled back since October, suggesting credit markets are unconcerned. But if the world stays flat, the pressure will rise.
BP splits off US energy unit
BP is creating a new business to manage its US onshore oil and gas assets, in an effort to compete more effectively with the smaller independent companies that dominate America’s shale industry.
Analysts said BP could ultimately sell the new unit if its performance did not improve.
Last year, the oil group said it planned to divest $10bn of assets by the end of next year – on top of the $38bn disposal programme implemented in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.
Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, played down the possibility of a sale, saying that the new US business “will remain a critical part of BP’s portfolio over the long term”.
However, he added that the move “creates optionality for us”.
BP will own the US unit, but it will operate separately from the rest of the company, be led by a separate management team and publish separate financials from 2015.
BP’s plan reflects the difficulties that oil majors including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell have had in trying to make money from US shale gas.
All have been hit by the driving down of US natural gas prices caused by the shale boom.
War fears decimate Russia stocks
Fears of a war in Ukraine wiped a 10th off the value of Moscow’s stock exchange and sent the rouble tumbling to an all-time low as the west scrambled to counter Russia’s creeping invasion of Crimea.
Investors fled Russian assets, with stocks in Moscow falling by 10.8 per cent, their biggest daily fall since the 2008 financial crisis.
Global markets also reacted to the prospect of a conflict and there was a jump in the price of commodities that are heavily dependent on Russia and Ukraine, such as wheat, oil and European natural gas.
The rouble, already one of the worse performing currencies, fell nearly 3 per cent to a record low of Rbs36.90 against the dollar before the central bank surprised the market by raising rates and spending at least $7bn propping up the rouble.
The market turmoil came as tensions continued to rise over Russia’s occupation of Crimea.
Ukraine’s defence ministry said its forces in Crimea had received an ultimatum from Russian forces to surrender to them by 5am local time today or face attack.
Russia dismissed the claims as “utter nonsense”.
The near 11 per cent slide in the rouble so far this year has raised fears of inflation in Russia, where people have painful memories of devaluations in 1997-98 and 2008-09.
Economists said the combination of higher inflation, rising interest rates and capital flight could tip the struggling Russian economy into recession.
“This is a security shock which will push Russia into a mild recession,” Jacob Nell, chief Russia economist at Morgan Stanley.
The impact rippled across global stock markets.
Equities tumbled as investors fled to safer assets such as government bonds.
The FTSE All-World share index fell 1.4 per cent – reversing last week’s gains and by lunchtime in New York, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent.
Wheat leapt 4.7 per cent, Brent crude oil rose 2.1 per cent and UK natural gas futures jumped by nearly 10 per cent.
The cost of insuring Ukrainian and Russian debt against a default jumped by 15 per cent.
Cooper Tire takes $29m hit from Chinese strikes
Chinese industrial action cost Cooper Tire $29m in the three months to September 30, the Ohio-based company reported, shedding rare light on the economic impact of a labour dispute in China.
While strikes are common across China, they typically occur at little-known suppliers.
On those rare occasions when labour unrest disrupts operations at a large multinational, the impact on a global company’s overall operations is usually not material enough to force disclosure about a specific strike’s financial cost.
The seven-month industrial action at Cooper’s joint venture Chengshan Tire factory in Shandong province derailed a $2.4bn bid by Apollo Tyres for Cooper, in what would have been the largest Indian takeover of a US company.
It also occurred at a facility that generates as much as one quarter of Cooper’s revenue and profit.
In a delayed third-quarter earnings report, Cooper said the strike had cost it $22m in reduced production and a further $7m in “manufacturing inefficiencies”.
The company incurred a further $5m in expenses related to the failed transaction during the quarter.
The losses in Shandong contributed to a 25 per cent year-on-year fall in third-quarter sales, to $832m.
Operating profit contracted almost 80 per cent compared with 2012, to $28m.
Cooper reported a net loss of $168,000 for the July-September period, compared with a net profit of $74m a year earlier.
Management and the workforce at Chengshan had opposed the proposed takeover by Apollo, arguing that it would saddle Cooper with too much debt.
The campaign for Scottish Independence suffered a setback yesterday when two of the country’s biggest employers warned on the risks of a Yes vote, in a sign that companies are ready to break their silence on the issue.
Standard Life, the insurance company that employs 5,000 people north of the border, said constitutional changes could prompt it to shift large parts of operations out of Scotland in the most significant intervention by a big company.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which has 12,000 staff in the country, also warned a vote for independence could damage its credit rating, although its chief executive insisted the group would remain “neutral” on the outcome of the referendum.
Until now few companies have been willing to enter the independence debate for fear of upsetting customers and staff.
However, if opinion polls continue to show nationalists narrowing the gap ahead of the vote in September then groups worried about the implications are more likely to speak out.
Standard Life, which has been based in Scotland since 1825, has started to register new entities in England, which would smooth any move south.
The future of the currency is its biggest concern, say people familiar with the matter.
The Royal Bank of Scotland said in its annual report: “A vote in favour of Scottish independence would be likely to significantly impact the group’s credit ratings.”
Second in size only to the City of London, the Scottish financial and professional services industry supports 150,000 jobs and accounts for nearly 13 per cent of the Scottish economy, says lobby group TheCityUK.
China denies direct role in renminbi’s decline
The renminbi has suffered its steepest weekly fall against the US dollar since China reformed its exchange rate system in 2005 in a move that some economists have interpreted as a warning from the country’s central bank to currency speculators.
The renminbi posted its seventh straight daily decline yesterday, sliding 0.02 per cent against the dollar to close at 6.1244 having hit its lowest level since early August in intraday trading.
One popular theory among economists and investors is that the People’s Bank of China engineered the depreciation because it was concerned about huge inflows of capital in recent months and wanted to show markets that trading the currency was not a one-way bet.
Analysts had been forecasting a continuation of the appreciation seen since late 2012.
However, the Chinese central bank used its first official statement on the sudden weakening of the country’s currency to say the sell-off was a reflection of market forces and should not be over-interpreted.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, an agency under the central bank, did not acknowledge any role in guiding the currency.
“The recent movement of the renminbi exchange rate is the result of market players adjusting their near-term trading strategies,” it said.
“The degree of exchange rate volatility is normal by the standards of developed and emerging markets.”
After huge investment and trade inflows at the start of the year, there was a clear reversal of the trend in February, according to China Financial News, a central bank newspaper.
“Risk appetite has weakened somewhat because of lower-than-expected growth data. Also, concerns about the property market have increased,” said Peng Wensheng, an economist with China International Capital Corp, the research group.
However, the hand of the ­Chinese central bank, which keeps a tight grip on the exchange rate, has been evident.
When the currency started falling last week it was the central bank that steadily lowered its daily reference rate, while banks and companies continued to trade it at a stronger level.
It was only over the past two days that the market-traded exchange rate fell below the daily rate set by the central bank – a sign that Beijing has, for now, succeeded in breaking at least some of the one-way bets on appreciation.
China faced immense capital inflows at the start of this year, according to data published on Tuesday by the central bank.
Banks bought a net $73bn of foreign currency in the onshore market from their clients who wanted renminbi in January, the biggest monthly amount on record.
Inflows have been accelerating since the middle of last year when China’s mountain of foreign exchange reserves grew by $500bn to $3.8tn.
Beijing faces up to failure in Xinjiang
The dramatic failure of China’s containment strategy for a long-running insurgency in the remote northwestern region of Xinjiang poses a grave policy challenge for Beijing.
The conflict, involving Muslim Uighurs who object to Chinese control of their energy-rich homeland, burst into the country’s heartland in a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 33 people in the southwestern city of Kunming on Saturday night.
The deadly assault by machete-wielding assailants, who struck at the city’s main railway station, also raises questions about whether the Chinese government’s hardline response to Uighur “separatism” has succeeded only in creating a more intractable crisis.
Last night the official Xinhua news agency said Chinese police had arrested three people involved in the attack and identified the group’s leader as Abdurehim Kurban.
Authorities killed another four suspects and apprehended a fifth at the railway station on Saturday.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Beijing has always maintained its conflict in Xinjiang is with unspecified “separatist” elements rather than with “Uighur” activists.
The distinction is important because it suggests that external or hostile forces – rather than the government’s own policies – are to blame for tensions in strategically important regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.
More than 100 people were killed in clashes in Xinjiang last year, mostly in remote areas where conflicting accounts of the incidents could not be independently checked.
The massacre in Kunming is the second time the conflict has spilled beyond Xinjiang’s borders since October, when three Uighurs drove a vehicle into a crowd in Tiananmen Square.
Although a highly symbolic attack at the centre of China’s capital, it killed only two bystanders.
Saturday’s mass killing, by contrast, was shocking for both its location and its death toll.
In Kunming yesterday clear blue skies and blooming flowers added to the sense of disbelief at what had occurred less than 48 hours earlier.
“The number of casualties and the impact of the violence are unprecedentedly high,” said Li Wei, an antiterrorism expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations.
“The terrorist threat is clearly moving beyond Xinjiang. The attack was carefully organised and planned. The people involved had been well trained.”
The savage nature of what some state media have called “China’s 9/11” was on graphic display on the ninth floor of the Number one Kunming People’s Hospital, where victims of the terror attack are recovering.
Most of the wounded were slashed in the head, their shaven scalps now criss-crossed with long scars and stitches.
Cao Nian described the moment when his 23-year-old girlfriend, Wang Hongli, was struck in the back of the head.
“I was seeing her off at the station when [the attackers] appeared,” he said.
“First there was one, then six. We were crouching down when they hit her.” The two staggered out of the station, running some 400 metres to find medical help.
Mr Cao, who was not injured in the attack, spoke as another casualty was wheeled by his sleeping girlfriend.
A deep scar cut across the right side of the victim’s head, which had been stitched.
A pool of blood was still evident in his ear.
“We are all appalled by this tragedy,” said Na Zhouhuai, a Muslim trader from China’s Hui ethnic group, as he waited for midday prayers to begin at the Shuncheng mosque.
“They killed ordinary people – ordinary people like us here. We believe that you should not even kill an ant.”
There was no police presence outside Mr Na’s mosque and surprisingly modest security at Kunming’s railway station, which was again crowded with travellers.
A banner outside the Shuncheng mosque in Kunming’s city centre urges worshippers to “strengthen ethnic relations and unity, construct a harmonious society”.
While a large number of police vans were parked near Dashuying, a mixed Uighur and Hui neighbourhood, officers were not visible on the streets.
“People are scared and business is down,” one restaurant owner said. “They rounded up some Uighurs here on Sunday.”
The detentions could not be confirmed.
Elsewhere, however, there were signs of a possible backlash brewing on the eve of the annual two-week session of China’s national parliament.
Li Fangping, a human rights lawyer representing a prominent Uighur scholar charged on Wednesday last week with separatist offences, posted on his blog a copy of a police notice from Nanning, another city in China’s southwest, asking local residents to report the arrival of any Uighur residents, businessmen or tourists in the area.
Nanning police declined to comment on the notice.
“This is a reaction to the central government’s top-down demand for stability. It’s their usual way of doing things,” said Mr Li.
“It’s an illegal and exaggerated response that won’t solve the crisis and will just make things worse.”
Big Brother can watch me at work any day
Last week the Financial Times published a scary story about how technology is being used by companies to spy on us at work.
It described how sensors can be easily and cheaply hidden in name badges and office furniture to track where we are, who we talk to and in what tone of voice.
HR departments can find out how long we take to get to work and how we behave when we get there.
In shops, call centres and even boardrooms, the data could be used to decide who to promote and who to fire.
I shuddered as I read the article – as did most FT readers.
Nineteen Eighty-Four is upon us, they commented online.
Totalitarianism is rampant! Privacy is down the plughole!
(Some of the comments are published in “Feedback” below).
Yet on closer inspection, the arrival of Big Brother in the corporate world is not necessarily such a bad thing.
Being constantly monitored by invisible devices might sound frightening but I’m not sure it is any more so than being monitored infrequently by visible human beings.
Under the present arrangement, we are observed in a haphazard and unscientific way by superiors who may well have made up their minds about us already, based on not much evidence at all.
Sod’s Law decrees that when you do something good, no one notices but the minute you do something bad you get caught.
I remember one boss who, once in a blue moon, would walk around the office; whenever he crept up behind me I was invariably writing a shopping list or was on the phone to my mum.
Such surveillance didn’t improve my behaviour, though it did increase my sense of injustice.
To have been monitored all the time – which would have put the shopping list in the context of otherwise diligent behaviour – would have been a vast improvement.
In most offices a raft of mainly pointless, cumbersome tools are used to assess performance, including “competency matrices”, appraisal interviews and psychometric testing.
Together they are so ineffective that according to a delightful piece of research by the University of Catania, companies would be no worse off promoting people at random.
If we are in favour of meritocracies, we should also be in favour of anything that helps us measure merit more accurately.
While the data collected by the new sensors are almost certainly too crude to offer much help now, I see no reason why in time (and probably quite soon) we will not have worked out exactly which behavioural quirks are the key to high (or low) performance, and found a decent, objective way of measuring them.
Steelcase, which makes some of the sensors so loathed by FT readers, hopes that one day they will not only be used to monitor juniors but in boardrooms too.
While it is hard to see directors willingly turning these tools upon themselves, it would be a terrific idea if they did.
At the moment, monitoring of boardroom behaviour is hopeless – outsiders periodically come in to observe, but such are the political sensitivities it is almost impossible for them to make a difference.
If, by contrast, all directors were wired up, anyone who banged on indefinitely, lowering the pulses of their boardroom colleagues, would be faithfully fingered by the technology.
Equally, the person who made the odd remark that made everyone sit up in their seats would also be marked out.
Knowing that the devices were there, and knowing the object of the exercise was to make incisive, controversial points, would improve board meetings no end.
It is objected that monitoring behaviour in offices would kill trust and spontaneity, making robots of us all.
But so long as everyone knew they were being monitored and understood what for, I don’t see why it should be such a terrifying idea – except perhaps for those who bully, shout at and harass others – and who have been getting away with it.
Far from making work less civilised, the arrival of Big Brother could make it more so.
Office life could become more transparent and less political.
And managers would be freed from having to play the role of policeman all day and allowed to get on with the more important role of helping people do a better job.
Some problems would need resolving.
For a start extensive monitoring could be illegal.
You would also have to ensure that workers were not able to subvert the process – and that wicked managers were not busily manipulating the data for their own devious ends.
Above all, for the system to work, you would need to have some faith in the regime that implemented it.
But then, if you don’t have any faith in the regime, the chances are that you are screwed anyway.
New steel plants cast doubt on China’s emission control plan
Steel plant closures central to the Chinese government’s plan for cutting pollution are likely to be outpaced by steel mills under construction, casting doubt on Beijing’s ability to make headway against air pollution enveloping northern China.
On Wednesday, Beijing was again gripped by the thick grey pall that has lingered over northern China for more than a week.
Public anger over air pollution has spurred the government to speed up the release of air monitoring data, and could strengthen the hand of environmental regulators in shutting down powerful polluters.
About 30m tonnes of new steel capacity across the country is still under construction, double the 15m tonnes of cuts pledged for 2014 by Hebei province, the industrial heartland surrounding Beijing which accounts for about a quarter of Chinese steel capacity.
Hebei agreed to the cuts as part of a national plan to reduce polluting emissions in the North China plain, where pollution regularly exceeds national standards.
State media showed footage of steel mills and cement plants being destroyed to underline the government’s resolve.
About 8m tonnes of capacity have been permanently closed down in Hebei since the plan was announced.
But so far, it is the least powerful polluters that have taken it on the chin.
“Generally speaking, the mills that have closed are older and unprofitable,” Wang Jiguang, a sales director at Hebei Iron and Steel Group, one of China’s largest steel producers, said at an iron ore conference organised by Metal Bulletin in Beijing.
Most of them have actually been idle for six months to a year already due to economic reasons.
Hebei pledged to cut its steel capacity by 60m tonnes by 2017, as part of a negotiated deal to reduce emissions in northern China, the Yangtze Delta and the Pearl River Delta while encouraging industrial investment in the arid west.
Meanwhile, the central government set up a $1.6bn fund to reward industry that complies with emission cuts, in recognition of the local jobs and taxes generated by polluting companies.
It is expected to transfer about $330m to Hebei province, which is also the source of most of Beijing’s power supply.
Past attempts by central planning agencies to reduce industrial capacity by fiat have similarly ended in tears, as plant bosses and the banks that lend to them almost always chose to expand rather than face closure.
Allowing the market to cull the inefficient producers has proved even more difficult in China, as state-owned steel companies are generally the worst performers.
Nearly every inland steel producer with more than 5m tonnes of capacity – in other words, at least a dozen of China’s biggest and most politically powerful mills – are losing money, according to industry expert Xu Zhongbo of Beijing Metal Consulting Ltd, with the exception of mills that have invested in automotive steel.
Policies directly tied to reducing pollution rather than cutting industrial capacity have generally been more effective.
For instance, about a decade ago China ordered the phase-out of the heavily polluting Soderberg process at aluminium smelters, and smelters were duly upgraded.
Power plants across China have installed emissions scrubbers, and have become more willing to use them in recent years after power subsidies were tweaked to reward their operation.
China’s mobile sector grows up superfast
The bustling shopping streets of Shanghai drive home the image of a country glued to mobile devices, often at the expense of passers-by shouldered out of the way by workers hurrying past with smartphone in hand.
The Chinese telecoms market was equally as urgent for the 75,000 people who descended on a bustling Barcelona last week for the industry’s biggest annual conference.
While Europeans and Americans have had superfast 4G services for several years, the close to a billion people signed up to China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile carrier, are only now being given their first sight of so-called 4G or LTE technology.
But such is the scale and speed at which China’s telecoms industry moves, driven by state policy, that there are already more 4G mobile masts installed in China than in the whole of Europe.
This gap will widen with a further wave of large tenders expected by the leading equipment makers in the next few months.
China’s adoption of 4G is not just a story about bringing faster internet speeds to the most populous nation.
The type of 4G technology – a standard called TD-LTE – used by China Mobile and its rivals means there are wide-ranging ramifications for device makers such as Apple and Samsung and telecoms equipment makers such as Ericsson and Nokia.
Not to mention homegrown technology champions such as Huawei, which is benefiting more than most from the country’s telecoms boom.
“The telecoms industry has been the poster child of the Chinese economic boom. A global standard based on a Chinese design is a prestige thing, and also an economic boon to the Chinese telecoms vendors,” says Tom Mowat, lead analyst for Analysys Mason’s Asia-Pacific team.
Need for speed
4G technology is capable of delivering the internet over mobile phones almost instantly, opening up a host of services and applications as well as a vast market for western technology groups such as Apple, which will finally be able to sell its iPhones to China Mobile’s 750m customers.
“By 2016, we estimate that China Mobile will be used for one in ten handsets globally,” says Mr Mowat.
The rapid adoption of superfast internet technology underscores the country’s economic and social development.
While Chinese companies were previously seen as cheap imitators of western groups, the introduction of superfast networks has meant new web-orientated businesses such as WeChat and Alibaba are already competing with Silicon Valley rivals.
This is not the first time China has sought to take a lead with its telecoms networks.
The battle for the 3G market has been fought with unblinking perseverance between GSM and CDMA standards over the past decade.
China Mobile, which favoured the TD-CDMA standard, lost. Most global networks now conform to GSM.
This is why there was no iPhone on China Mobile’s network for so many years and why visitors to the Beijing Olympics complained about the poor mobile service at such an important event.
“The government had to force it down the throat of China Mobile and even then the company could not really make it work,” says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA, an inward investment group.
With 4G, China’s TD standard is not necessarily a competing technology to the more common FDD-LTE technology, since both can coexist in handsets.
Equipment makers will not be forced to choose between competing technologies – and as such will give the TD standards a far higher chance of success.
The Chinese market is also more mature now, and the sheer scale of the rollout this time involving all three of the country’s telecoms groups means there is a much higher chance of putting the TD technology at the heart of the global telecoms market.
Standards battle
The scale of the 4G programme gives the adopted standard momentum – and China the opportunity to take the lead in the next generation of global broadband technology.
In a growing battle over future technology standards, analysts say China is sponsoring the less popular form of technology through widespread domestic take-up.
There are only about 17 TD-LTE mobile networks commercially available worldwide – or one in 40 LTE connections globally.
“The world’s largest operator running this sort of network immediately turns [TD-LTE] into a very successful global standard,” says Mr Mowat.
Division of the spoils
There are some ironies in China’s bold ambitions for the introduction of superfast mobile broadband, given the internet can be incredibly slow because of the “Great Firewall” that blocks or filters foreign sites.
But the speed of the rollout needs to be seen in the context of a telecoms industry largely controlled by the state.
“China Mobile has $65bn on its balance sheet so it can afford to build out very quickly. The government sees its balance sheet as a useful tool,” says Tucker Grinnan, regional head of telecoms for HSBC in Asia.
Much of the work to build the 4G network has been won by Chinese groups such as Huawei and ZTE, which deny direct links to the state.
Western groups such as Ericsson, NSN and Alcatel-Lucent have won sizeable contracts, but some of their executives have expressed dissatisfaction about China Mobile awarding all three western manufacturers a seemingly arbitrary 11 per cent each of its Rmb20bn ($3.25bn) 4G contract.
Beyond 4G
Chinese technology groups are not stopping at 4G in the race for industry leadership, with Huawei committing significant resources to the next generation of so-called “5G” technology.
CCS Insight, a UK-based research group, predicts China will become the leader in next-generation mobile technology in the next two years, leaving behind a Europe where authorities are belatedly pushing the industry to invest “to regain former glory”.
Huawei said that by 2018 it would invest at least $600m in research into 5G technology capable of speeds more than 100 times faster than 4G.
That investment is far more than has been claimed by any western rival.
Indeed, this has now become a battle of regional interests to seek an edge in next-generation technology.
The march towards superfast mobile internet in China has been speeded by government efforts and the desire to create a market to benefit its technology champions.
China consumers will enjoy world-class network quality, with resulting benefits to the internet groups already growing rapidly in the country, though censors will probably continue keeping a close tab on content.
The US is currently negotiating major trade agreements across the Atlantic and Pacific.
Both deals are historic in scope, offering us a chance to shape the global economy in ways that strengthen US leadership in the world and the American middle class at home.
Many in Congress and in my own party view new trade agreements sceptically and are reluctant to offer their support.
I understand the pressures these lawmakers face.
But I am convinced that the two deals we are negotiating are in America’s best interest, and that politicians will ultimately be rewarded for making them happen.
That is why President Barack Obama and I are committed to seeing them through.
The global economy is at an inflection point.
The choices we make now will determine our role in the world for decades to come.
We have an opportunity to shape the path of global commerce to spread our values and benefit our people, and we should seize it.
The US has been the world’s pre-eminent economic power for many years and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
But the rise of new economic powers means we will face fierce competition from more places than ever before.
America’s economic relations with the rest of the world matter more now than ever before.
Countries that throw up protectionist barriers and distort their economies to favour state-owned enterprises are challenging rules of the road that we have relied on for decades.
The question is whether the US will take a leadership role in shaping a new course that reflects American values – or whether we will stand on the sidelines as a new order unfolds.
The two agreements now in the works would place the US at the centre of two vast trading regions.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership would connect America to economies as diverse as Japan, Malaysia and Chile.
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership would significantly deepen what is already a multitrillion-dollar economic relationship with the EU.
Together they would unite nearly two-thirds of the world economy in support of open and fair economic competition.
Both of the deals will increase US exports and help attract good middle-class jobs to America.
When 95 per cent of the world’s customers live beyond our borders, exports are critical.
Outside studies have found that the TPP and TTIP would each increase exports by more than $120bn a year.
Some 44m Americans work for companies that export goods.
Jobs supported by exports pay as much as 18 per cent higher than the national average.
After decades when our economy grew but the middle class took a beating, Americans are understandably worried about rising inequality at home.
The president and I are determined to address this.
So the deals we are negotiating are different from those our country has signed before, reflecting the lessons of two decades of globalisation.
They include unprecedented steps to protect labour standards, the environment and intellectual property, as well as new commitments against favouritism for state-owned enterprises.
They require nations that might otherwise try to undercut us to match our high standards instead.
Our exports still face barriers in many countries.
These agreements must level the playing field.
America has less than a 1 per cent share of Japan’s automobile market.
As I have said directly to Japan’s leaders, we must address barriers to American car exports if we hope to move forward.
But the benefits are not just economic.
As America reasserts its role as a Pacific power, many in the region are asking whether we are there to stay.
Deploying soldiers and diplomats is essential.
But as other nations use their economic might to compete for influence and even coerce smaller neighbours, there is no substitute for robust American economic engagement – on behalf of our own companies and in defence of open commerce and fair competition.
The TPP has become a symbol of American staying power.
We must see it through.
Our European allies are already our security partners of first resort, from Libya to Afghanistan.
TTIP will spur growth that helps both sides of the Atlantic continue to modernise and invest in the most powerful alliance in history.
When a president receives support and guidance from Congress, that strengthens America’s hand at the negotiating table.
That is why the president and I have asked Congress to grant us trade promotion authority.
This means that Congress outlines US objectives in detail and sets the terms for close consultation.
Congress gets the final say when it puts the resulting agreements to a simple vote.
I realise trade can be a contentious issue.
Having run for office a few times myself, I do my best never to tell another man or woman his or her politics.
But I also believe that good policy makes good politics.
And trade that strengthens America’s middle class is both.
North Korea fires short range missiles
North Korea has fired two short range missiles in a second apparent show of displeasure with US-South Korean joint exercises that began last week.
The South Korean defence ministry said two missiles were fired from near the post city of Wonsan at 6.19am on Monday.
They travelled more than 500 kilometres into the ocean, but did not appear to be targeting South Korean vessels.
This comes after North Korea performed a similar exercise on Friday, firing four short-range missiles.
The defence ministry also said South Korea was monitoring the situation, with no special alert footing declared.
North Korea typically protests strongly against the annual major exercises by US and South Korean troops, which it labels preparation for an invasion.
Its ambassador to London warned early last month that the joint exercises may bring the peninsula "to the brink of war", echoing bellicose rhetoric that grabbed global media attention last year.
However, Pyongyang has made a series of statements over the past two months stressing its desire to improve relations with Seoul, and last month it hosted the first reunions of families divided by the inter-Korean border since 2010.
The South Korean ministry of defence said the joint exercises will continue as planned.
For Chinese internet finance, small is beautiful
Internet Finance is a term drawing massive attention from cities to villages across China.
By broad definition, internet finance – which includes Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending and crowd funding – includes any organisation that extends their financial applications to the public over internet or any other IP network.
Heated discussion surrounds the question of whether internet finance may replace conventional banking in China, unlike in many countries where it has undergone an evolution alongside conventional banking.
To see the future of this competition, we first need to understand the fundamental differences between them.
Here let us focus on a particular class of internet finance as an example – online lending – which includes two popular models.
One is based on e-commerce, in which loans are provided to registered customers such as with Ali finance in China and Amazon in the US.
The other model is P2P lending, such Lufax and PP Dai in China, and Kabbage, Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace in the US and European countries.
Almost all online lending organisations in China and overseas target small clients.
The lending quotas of Ali Finance, for example, range from $8,000 to $160,000 and the minimum investment in Lufax is around $1,500.
The average loan amount of Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace, the two largest P2P platforms in US, is around $12,000 and $7,000 respectively.
In contrast to internet finance, a lot of conventional banks prefer large customers rather than small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The China Minsheng Bank, for instance, is famous for its smaller scale client business in China which has seen it lend to about 1m enterprises, but even here the average loan amount has been approximately $250,000 – significantly higher than that of online lending platforms.
The main reason for this dichotomy lies in the different risk management operations of conventional banks and internet finance companies.
Conventional banks rely heavily on collateral, guarantees and offline information collection, while online platforms usually require no such collateral or guarantees while relying on online information sources.
The offline information collection and collateral management functions of conventional banks are consuming of time and money; meaning that the marginal cost of such work diminishes as the size of the loan increases.
No wonder therefore that banks prefer granting big loans based on collateral.
By contrast, online lending usually doesn’t require borrowers to provide collateral or guarantees.
But what makes online supply chain lending different is that they can obtain real-time transaction information through e-commerce platforms.
With sufficient information input, the lending platform may trust statistical models to evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness.
As the borrowers are usually small ones, they are very likely to be independent of each other, and idiosyncratic risks can be diversified away, lowering the overall risk of the lending portfolio.
Although statistical models do not guarantee 100 per cent accurate evaluations of borrowers, sound models can provide a stable accuracy ratio over time.
Nevertheless, the limited access to the credit information of individual borrowers on P2P platforms constrains risk management in P2P lending.
The truth is that a lot of burgeoning P2P platforms in China have no basic risk diversification, not to mention the risk management.
Yet predicting the future based on our current experience is very difficult, if ever possible.
Nevertheless, whether choosing large clients or small clients depends on the risk management procedure a lending organization adopts.
Based on this principal, I would imagine online lending will keep focusing on small loans.
In particular, establishing a reliable and inexpensive credit information platform is the key to the real boom of P2P lending industry, in addition to strengthening regulation.
For banks, as interest rate liberalisation proceeds, lending to small borrowers may become a “must do”.
In this case, banks need to find a way to lower the cost of information collection and credit evaluation procedure.
Liang Xiaozhong is deputy director of the China Banking Regulatory Commission
The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of China Banking Regulatory Commission.
On being asked about his wife, Chen Dongsheng stiffens in his large ivory-coloured armchair, but stays calm.
His office manager and translator looks more weary than worried by a question about Kong Dongmei.
In China, guanxi, or connections, have always been important, but rampant corruption in recent years has in-grained a deep cynicism about al-most all such links.
Ms Kong is a granddaughter of Mao Zedong, foun-der of the People’s Republic of China and after Mr Chen married Ms Kong in 2011, the couple began to attract innuendo-laden media coverage.
Ms Kong, a decade younger than 56-year-old Mr Chen, has worked at his insurance company, Taikang Life, since its earliest days.
She also helps run a Beijing cultural centre and bookshop dedicated to communist history, and has written books about her grandfather, leading some to denigrate her for profiting from his legacy.
“Usually, I do not answer questions on my private life,” Mr Chen says, as we sit side by side in diplomatic formation beneath large, classical Chinese paintings.
“[But] I can say that the connection of my wife has not much to do, or even has no relationship, with my business.”
That should be businesses.
Mr Chen has founded three private companies in China and remains the largest shareholder of each.
His business card shows he is chief executive and chairman of Taikang Life, China’s only national life insurer with no direct government ownership, and the country’s fourth biggest by new business sales.
The card’s flipside denotes his other roles: founder and chairman of China Guardian, the world’s third biggest fine art auction house after Soth-eby’s and Christie’s; and founder of ZJS Express, a Beijing-based delivery company run by Mr Chen’s brother.
He set up all three companies from scratch, starting in the early 1990s when Deng Xiaoping, then the Chinese leader, undertook his “southern tour” in 1992 to promote market ref-orms.
Deng wanted to stir China out of the political, social and econ-om-ic slump it entered after 1989’s pro-democracy protests were crushed.
Mr Chen insists the three companies grew by being professional and pursuing market-oriented strategies.
The Mao name does of course still carry great prestige but the Mao family have faded from politics over many years, he says.
“There is a saying that the hong-er-dai [second generation reds] is different from the guan-er-dai [second generation officials],” he says. “For sure [the former] enjoy great glory and are in the spotlight, but they don’t have much relationship with real politics and the economy.”
Such connections, however, mean “we have to be more cautious, as whether you do it right or wrong, you always attract jealousy and disapproval”.
However, he is adamant that his businesses thrive because of “corporate culture, core competitiveness, teams and brands, and not [through] government connections”.
His words are measured and Mr Chen himself is not flashy.
Today he is dressed plainly and his long, greying sideburns and low-rise quiff are from a different era to the shining jet-black coiffures of China’s political leaders.
Taikang’s offices are smart rather than opulent, although a baby-grand piano stands incongruously be-hind the executive floor receptionists.
Later, Mr Chen levels a more direct criticism at the guan-er-dai.
“The hong-er-dai didn’t take ad-vantage and [maintained] a revolutionary quality,” he says. “The children of the recent government officials, however, made lots of money through their connection and power.”
People who know Mr Chen personally or have dealt with his companies echo his depiction of his path to success.
Insurance executives and bankers describe him as extremely bright and hard working, and a charismatic leader of the 220,000 sales agents who deliver 60 per cent of his profits by selling life products door to door, as agents still do across much of Asia.
When Mr Chen first got the business bug he left a safe job as an assistant researcher in the former Ministry of International Business and Cooperation in Beijing.
It took four years for China to open up insurance to private capital and allow Taikang to win a licence.
Since then, China Guardian has been run by co-founder Wang Yannan, while Mr Chen focused on Taikang.
The notion that the Chinese central bank is waging a campaign against currency speculators conjures up an image of Beijing taking on shadowy hedge funds managed by George Soros and his cohorts.
The reality is more prosaic and hits closer to home: much of the so-called speculation on renminbi appreciation has been longer-term investment, and many of the investors are Chinese actors, including state-owned companies, rather than global financiers.
By guiding the renminbi down by 1 per cent over the past week – its steepest depreciation since China introduced a new currency system in 2005 – the People’s Bank of China has rekindled uncertainty about the exchange rate.
In so doing, bankers and traders who deal with the PBoC say it wants to encourage Chinese companies to be more cautious before betting on sustained appreciation – caution which in itself could slow the renminbi’s rise.
In early 2012 when Beijing widened the renminbi’s daily trading band, it vowed to make the currency more volatile, as likely to fall as it is to rise.
But since September of that year, it had drifted upwards without interruption, gaining 5 per cent against the dollar.
“The PBoC can scream its head off about two-way [exchange rate] volatility, but for the past year and a half, the renminbi has only risen. It was a no-brainer to borrow dollars. It wasn’t speculation. It was a sure thing,” said a bank strategist in Shanghai.
The main way in which Chinese companies have bet on a stronger renminbi is by borrowing dollars offshore, mainly in Hong Kong, and remitting that money into the mainland.
The advantages of dollar debt are clear: the renminbi’s appreciation makes eventual repayment easier and, more importantly, offshore interest rates are much lower than Chinese rates.
UBS estimates that banks in Hong Kong and Singapore have lent mainland companies around $200bn over the past 12 months alone and that $170bn of this has been sent back to the mainland.
Chinese companies have also been highly active in offshore bond markets.
Some of that offshore borrowing went into purely speculative carry trades.
Investors used it to take punts on the Chinese property market or to buy high-yielding shadow-bank products.
But much of it also went to the “real” economy, with property companies becoming particularly reliant on Hong Kong for financing.
Offshore debt accounts for 87 per cent of the total debt of China Overseas Land and Investment, a state-owned company that is one of the mainland’s biggest real estate developers.
Safe investing practice dictates that companies borrowing in dollars to spend renminbi should hedge their currency exposure.
Normally, they would buy contracts that guarantee them dollars at an agreed-upon price in the future when they need to repay the loans.
But the relentless appreciation of the renminbi changed that calculation.
“Because borrowers thought there was no risk, many just decided to take the dollar spot price in two years’ time,” said Zhou Hao, an analyst with ANZ.
If the PBoC could make the renminbi regain volatility, it will force people borrowing offshore to hedge their risk and that will work against renminbi appreciation.
The one area in which Chinese companies have hedged heavily has been in covering their exposure to dollar earnings.
Exporters, which earn dollars but pay costs in renminbi, have been highly active in buying derivatives.
For example, Morgan Stanley estimates that $350bn of target redemption forwards – a product that pays out when the renminbi rises to a certain level – have been sold since the start of 2013.
A steeper fall in the renminbi could lead to big losses for exporters, but it would be wrong to blame speculation alone for the boom in these derivatives.
“Better export performance was also a key factor. It was largely hedging, though some might have over-hedged and taken a more aggressive view,” said Liu Linan, a strategist with Deutsche Bank.
Strong demand for renminbi in Hong Kong at the start of this year also added to the complications in China.
Because the renminbi was trading at a premium in Hong Kong, Chinese oil companies – the country’s biggest corporate buyers of dollars – shifted there to buy dollars, according to a currency trader with a bank in Beijing.
The resulting drop in dollar demand in China fuelled more appreciation pressure in the mainland market.
That has gone into reverse with this week’s drop in the renminbi.
As companies and investors in Hong Kong unwind their positions, the currency’s fall in the offshore market has been even steeper than in China, eliminating the Hong Kong premium.
“The oil companies have come back onshore to buy dollars. That is what the PBoC wanted to see,” the trader said.
Most of the world’s internet titans are snapping up mobile apps and start-ups, from WhatsApp to AutoNavi to Viber.
Sina is going the opposite way.
It has appointed banks for a partial spinout of its Weibo platform, a Twitter-like microblog for the Chinese market.
Why exit as others mob the entrance?
Sina has given no details yet.
It doesn’t need the cash.
It held $1.2bn in net cash as of September – equivalent to a quarter of its current market capitalisation and nearly four times its 2012 cash burn (cash flow data for 2013 are not yet available).
That leaves the desire for a higher valuation as the most likely motive.
Alibaba bought an 18 per cent stake in Sina’s Weibo in April, stamping it with a value of $3.3bn.
But the prices of big and growing mobile communications assets have risen merrily since then.
Weibo had 60m daily active users in the third quarter of last year, and Barclays reckons it has 195m monthly users.
The market values the monthly users at Facebook and Twitter at $142 and $126 apiece, respectively.
Rakuten’s purchase of Viber rates its users at $90.
Facebook just paid about $42 a subscriber for WhatsApp.
Using that last figure, Weibo would be worth $8.2bn (on what is clearly a very imprecise valuation method).
Sina’s 71 per cent stake is then worth $5.8bn – against Sina’s total market capitalisation of $4.9bn.
The logic of the valuations may be hard to understand.
The urge to chase them is not.
This leaves two issues outstanding.
First, what happens to the rest of Sina?
Its other business is selling internet advertising.
That is a slower-growth business, and Sina disclosures make it difficult to know how profitable it is.
Second: where is Alibaba?
It has an option to increase its stake to 30 per cent.
If it does not do so before the float, investors may be spooked – just as their excitement about all things mobile is peaking.
Merkel joins anti-US spying push
German chancellor Angela Merkel has thrown her weight behind calls for Europe to develop internet services that are walled off from the US.
Ms Merkel’s weekend comments come despite intensive efforts by President Barack Obama to quell European anger over the National Security Agency revelations made public by former contractor Edward Snowden, including documents that showed that US spy agencies had tapped Ms Merkel’s mobile phone.
Ms Merkel said she would press French president Franois Hollande to back the push for EU-based alternatives to the current US-dominated internet infrastructure when she holds talks in Paris on Wednesday.
“We’ll talk with France about how we can maintain a high level of data protection,” Ms Merkel said in her weekly podcast.
“Above all, we’ll talk with European providers that offer security for our citizens, so that one shouldn’t have to send emails and other information across the Atlantic.”
One US company, which refused to be named, said there were questions over the practicalities of how email between the US and countries in this undefined new service would work.
Some tech experts have warned that proposals to build alternative networks in Europe fail to take account of how the internet operates, or the continued legal obligation of American companies to turn information over to the NSA, no matter where it is stored.
Ms Merkel’s decision to throw her personal backing behind EU-centric internet services reflects how politically charged the issue is in Germany.
Alibaba opens the door to US platform
Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company that has long -connected US brands to Chinese suppliers, now wants to help sell goods to American -consumers.
The company, which is poised for an initial public offering that analysts say could value it at more than $100bn, announced yesterday that it would launch its first majority-owned ecommerce venture in the US.
Two of Alibaba’s US subsidiaries, Vendio and Auctiva, will soon launch a business-to-consumer site, called 11 Main.
Alibaba did not give further details about 11 Main beyond describing it as a boutique ecommerce platform selling “interesting quality products” from “handpicked shop owners”.
The move is the latest by Alibaba to seek additional sources of growth.
Alibaba’s sites control 80 per cent of China’s ecommerce, and revenues from those sites last quarter grew by more than half to $1.78bn, but the rate of growth has slowed since last year.
Earlier this week, it made an unsolicited bid to take private AutoNavi, in an all-cash deal that values the mapping company at $1.6bn.
The deal would allow Alibaba to improve its mobile commerce capabilities.
Alibaba is also expanding into wealth management services and taxi hailing apps in China.
Alibaba now markets in the US mainly using Aliexpress, an English language website intended to connect US businesses with wholesalers in China.
It operates mostly in emerging markets such as Russia, India, Chile and Brazil, but also in the US.
A person with knowledge of the 11 Main launch cautioned against portraying it as a foray by Alibaba into the US, saying that despite having full ownership the venture wouild be run independently by its two subsidiaries.
Aside from a few Communist Youth League banners and a summary of the reforms unveiled at the Chinese Communist party’s third plenum last November, there is little to distinguish Dongfeng’s wholly owned Aeolus car plant from its nearby joint venture with Peugeot Citroen and Honda.
Situated in a development zone in Wuhan, an industrial city in central China, the Aeolus factory has borrowed equipment and manufacturing systems from both Peugeot and Nissan, state-owned Dongfeng’s third joint venture partner.
The parking lots outside each plant, however, tell a different story.
While thousands of cars are lined up outside Dongfeng’s Peugeot and Honda factories in Wuhan, awaiting shipment to distributors across the world’s largest car market, its Aeolus factory produces only about 300 vehicles a day, or about 100,000 units annually.
Dongfeng, one of China’s “Big Three” automobile groups alongside Shanghai Auto and First Auto Works, has more joint ventures with international car groups than any of its domestic peers.
Including Korean partner Hyundai, it currently operates four joint ventures and signed a fifth partnership agreement in December with Renault.
The Wuhan-based company is also poised to take a 14 per cent stake in Peugeot as part of a ￠3bn capital raising.
Dongfeng’s four joint ventures account for more than 90 per cent of the group’s annual passenger car sales, dwarfing those of its own Aeolus brand.
It is an imbalance shared by all of China’s state-owned car companies and helps explain why the country that boasts the world’s biggest car market has, unlike Japan and Korea before it, thus far failed to produce a national champion of its own that can compete globally.
“On the plus side, joint ventures spin off a tremendous amount of profit for the state-owned enterprises that they’re affiliated with,” says Bill Russo of Synergistics, an industry consultancy.
“On the negative side, those profits are a drug that you become dependent on. Chinese car companies haven’t really been successful at investing them into their own branded vehicles.”
Last month(jan), the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced that the country’s car sales rose more than 15 per cent last year to 18m units – almost triple the number sold in 2008.
During this period, the market share of Chinese brands peaked at 31 per cent in 2010 and has since fallen to 27 per cent.
Meanwhile, China’s 2013 car exports fell almost 10 per cent year on year to just 596,300 units – accounting for only 3.3 per cent of total production.
Imports, meanwhile, nearly tripled to 1.1m vehicles, driven by strong demand for luxury vehicles.
While China exports more cars to Algeria than any other country – with its next biggest markets being Russia, Chile and Iran – the largest source of its own automotive imports is Germany.
“The quality of Chinese cars currently can’t compete with multinationals,” says Yao Jie, deputy secretary-general of the association. “We need to work harder to improve domestic brands.”
According to CAAM, last year China’s 10 most popular models, led by the Ford Focus, were all manufactured by Sino-foreign joint ventures.
“Most Chinese state car companies know how to bolt a car together,” agrees Max Warburton, car analyst with Bernstein Research.
“But replicating a foreign manufacturing system is not a particularly valuable skill set. Real skills lie in product development and in future technology.”
On a tour of Dongfeng’s Aeolus plant, employees are humble but also determined.
“I feel that we can catch up but it will take a long time, perhaps 10 years,” says Huang Mingke, a line manager who gave up a job with Dongfeng’s Peugeot joint venture even though the Aeolus plant generally pays lower wages than the joint ventures.
“We are investing a lot in critical components, such as engines and transmissions.”
Tao Haiying, a company official, adds: “Although we have borrowed some advanced management techniques from Peugeot and Nissan, it’s only a foundation on which we are building. We can study and absorb their best practices as we create our own.”
Many analysts believe Dongfeng and its domestic peers will have to sort out their competitive issues at home before they can emerge as a threat overseas.
“Maybe China can do something that no one else has, but I haven’t ever seen a car company become a successful exporter without having stable development in their home market first,” says Mr Russo.
“You have to achieve a certain size and scale at home before you can compete away.”
The challenge for China’s car companies will be to achieve this in the world’s most competitive automotive industry.
When Japan and Korean automakers broke out in the 1970s and 1980s, they did so from the shelter of protected home markets.
Dongfeng’s pending deal with Peugeot and Geely’s acquisition of Sweden’s Volvo in 2010 suggest another way forward.
What Chinese car companies lack in experience, they can make up for in cash.
Last year Geely established a research centre in Sweden, while Peugeot offers Dongfeng a tempting short-cut in some key areas.
On 8 March 2014, the Second Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress held a press conference at its Press Center and invited Wang Yi, China's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to answer questions from Chinese and foreign journalists about China's foreign policy and external relations.
Wang Yi: Good morning, everyone.
It is a great pleasure to meet with journalists from the press.
At the outset, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I would like to thank you for your interest in and understanding of China's diplomacy. I would also like to thank you for your efforts in reporting on China.
Today is the International Women's Day.
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my best festive greetings to all the ladies in this room, including those behind the cameras.

Signs of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane point to an oil slick in the Gulf of Thailand. The 12-mile-long streak of oil could be a clue as to what happened to the Boeing 777-200 that was carrying 239 passengers early Saturday morning. Flight MH370 wound up lost after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.
New York Times reports March 8 that Malaysia’s prime minister, Mr. Najib, said 15 aircraft and nine ships were out searching for the jet.
It has not been confirmed that the MH370 flight lost crashed, but fuel tanks were limited in the distance it had.
The possible Malaysia Airlines oil slick discovered, would benefit crash survivors if it landed in the Gulf of Thailand due to shallow waters in that area versus deep waters in the Atlantic.
Suspicions of foul play showed up when authorities learned that two foreign citizens who stole passports from Asia were on flight MH370.
One was an Italian and another an Austrian.
The Italian man is identified as Luigi Maraldi.
An Austrian spokesperson did not identify the Austrian.
An anonymous U.S. official want to make clear that this does not mean an act ofterrorism occurred.
“We are not ruling out anything,” said chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, Saturday night.“As far as we are concerned right now, it’s just a report.”
According to the report from Malaysia Airlines, passengers on the plane included "two infants, and an all-Malaysian crew of 12. The passengers included 154 citizens from China or Taiwan, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans, as well as two citizens each from Canada, New Zealand and Ukraine and one each from Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia."
The mythical bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may not be a myth after all.
He may in fact be a rumpled 64-year-old man named Satoshi Nakamoto who is living quietly in the San Gabriel Valley.
A Newsweek magazine reporter says she followed a trail that led her to a Satoshi Nakamoto in Temple City.
When the reporter went to Nakamoto's home unannounced, he apparently called the Temple City police, who stood watch as a short interview was conducted.
"Now face to face, with two police officers as witnesses, Nakamoto's responses to my questions about bitcoin were careful but revealing," according to the Newsweek article.
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand.
'It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection. "
It has been widely believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was a fake name for a programmer, probably much younger, who wished to be anonymous.
And the Satoshi Nakamoto tracked down by Newsweek is living in a modest house.
But it's believed that the real Satoshi Nakamoto holds bitcoins worth about $400 million.
One thing is clear: If this is the real bitcoin inventor, his life many never be the same now that his true identity has been revealed.

As relationships go, theirs is surely one of the most enduring.
Now Mr and Mrs Potato Head have had their nuptials captured on film by an inventive wedding photographer in a bid to explain his work to his young son.
Chris Thornton, 34, was left at a loss when his three-year old son Cole asked what he did for a living.
As he was a big fan of Toy Story, Mr Thornton decided to put together some shots of the characters in the traditional wedding photograph poses.
The result will delight fans of the famous Disney Pixar films as it shows all of the characters in wedding dresses and top hats.
Mr Thornton's mother made the outfits and her house played venue for the cartoon festivities.
She even played prop assistant by pouring a watering can to provide a back drop of rain for some sparkling backdrops.
One of his most popular shots in the five years he's been photographing weddings features Buzz Lightyear holding the brides shoes.
Mr Thornton, from Leeds, said: “Cole's first big love was Toy Story. It was one of the first things that he would sit and watch for longer than 15 minutes. And of course I love it too. Cole would always ask when I'm heading out of the house if I'm going to take pictures at a wedding. ”
Although he didn't really understand what this was or wasn't at all interested in any of the photos.
I thought I'd try and shoot a wedding that he'd be really interested in and use my job to make him smile.
“Since then he's actually got his own little camera and did take some shots at a recent wedding I was invited to.”
Cameras in the zoo's Panda House show Yuan Zai — whose name van be translated to mean "Yuan Yuan's child” or literally the "the little round thing" — slowly sliding down a hall into a common area with a mischievous smirk on her face.
She was crawling on her stomach as if to avoid detection.
Yuan Yuan sees her daughter and walks over to put her back.
She first grabs her by the neck using her mouth, and then cradles her and carries her back to her bed.
The baby did not seem happy, but couldn’t put up much of a fight.
Yuan Zai, who was born on July 6, probably needs her rest as her family is the biggest attraction at the zoo.
The zoo can accomodate up to 19,000 people a day to come and see the panda family, which also includes father Tuan Tuan.
Most young adults now choose to end relationships via text, followed closely by social media.
Gone are the days of giving someone the courtesy of a face-to-face chat - most break-ups are now conducted digitally.
More than half (56 per cent) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship by means of technology.
Many said they chose technology as it makes the process 'less awkward', reveals a new report.
The American men and women surveyed had all gone through a break up in the past 12 months, and all 2,712 respondents were aged 18-30.
Those taking part were asked how their last relationships had ended, and had to describe the 'means through which your break-up was finalised'.
More than half (56 per cent) of those who went through a break-up last year ended their relationship digitally; either through text message, social media or email.
Two in three (62 per cent) of the respondents claimed that they had been the one to end their last relationship.
The majority (55 per cent) who ended their relationship via text message explained that it made the process 'less awkward', while 61 per cent of those who dumped on social media said they did so as they had 'deleted or blocked' their last partner's phone number.
More than half (58 per cent) of those who broke up through email claimed they had chosen that method as it allowed them to 'fully explain their reasons.'
When asked if they would be annoyed if they were broken up with digitally, three quarters, 73 per cent, of those taking part said 'yes'.
When asked why, the majority, 60 per cent, claimed they felt it would be 'too impersonal'.
According to the results, just 2 per cent of respondents claimed to have broken up using a good old fashioned written letter.
The study was conducted by vouchercloud.net as part of research into the part that technology plays in the lives of American consumers, given that 'technology coupons' were amongst the top searched-for on site for the past 12 months consecutively.
'Digital has well and truly taken over, even when it comes to our relationships it seems,' says a spokesperson.
'However you want to break up is entirely up to you, but it may be worth noting that we found that quite a lot of people would be hurt by a digital break-up, as it's seen as a little too impersonal.
When spouses cheat on each other, the fallout can be absolutely disastrous.
Making a scene in public isn’t that uncommon, but this clever wife in Texas found a better, subtler way to let everyone know how disappointed she was in her cheating husband.
She took out a classified ad in a Texas newspaper, sending a message out to her husband and his mistress, signed with love.
You’re going to love this.
When Timeshia Brown discovered her husband Patrick was sleeping around and got a girl pregnant, she didn’t set his car on fire. She did, however, find a better way to burn him.
Her ad reads:
I would like to say congratulations to Shara Cormier and Patrick Brown.
They are expecting a baby.
Hope you both are really in love and I hope it works out.
It’s possible she meant some of the well-wishing, but you know for sure she was laughing all the way to the newspaper.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been nominated for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize; but the conflict in Ukraine is also likely to be on the Nobel committee's agenda.
A record 278 candidates, including 47 organizations, received nominations for the 2014 prize, said the Norwegian Nobel Institute's director, Geir Lundestad.
Committee members who met on Tuesday added their own proposals with a focus on recent turmoil around the globe.
"Part of the purpose of the committee's first meeting is to take into account recent events, and committee members try to anticipate what could be the potential developments in political hotspots," Lundestad said.
Russia seized control of Ukraine's Crimea region after President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted on February 22, prompting the most serious confrontation between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War.
Pope Francis and former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden also received nominations as well as Putin.
Although nominations are kept secret for 50 years, thousands of people around the world are eligible to propose candidates, including any member of any national assembly, and many make their picks public.
The committee narrowed its list to between 25 and 40 on Tuesday and it will cut its list to about a dozen by the end of April.
First awarded in 1901, the prize includes 8 million Swedish crowns ($1.24 million) in cash.
The winner will be announced on the second Friday of October and the prize will be presented on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.
This year’s gathering of China’s official lawmaking and top political advisory bodies, which will rubber-stamp laws and policies decided by the ruling Communist party, will be closely watched as it is the first to be held since President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang formally took the reins of government, writes Jamil Anderlini in Beijing.
Each year there is talk about whether or not these gatherings of China’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Congress remain just a political pageant, or if the party is allowing more debate to creep in.
The main topics at this week’s event are likely to include:
Growth targets
These are expected to remain unchanged, but if they are it could provide useful insight into the new leaders’ thinking on the strength of the economy and how willing they are to accept lower rates of growth as they try to reform the economic model.
Real estate policy
After years of ineffectual attempts to rein in the booming property market, there are some signs the leadership is preparing policies to bring down residential prices, a source of discontent among the growing urban population.
The annual government report is often used to announce such policies.
Other areas
Reform of state-owned enterprises, pollution, foreign relations, local government debt and shadow banking.
Washington’s outgoing ambassador to Beijing has ended his three-year posting on a combative note, saying Chinese travellers’ experience of freedoms and democracy during trips to the US could encourage them to “want some of those same things”.
Gary Locke is leaving Beijing at a time of heightened Sino-US tension over issues ranging from President Barack Obama’s recent meeting with the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, to Beijing’s declaration of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea last year.
Since his appointment in 2011, Mr Locke has been at the centre of a series of diplomatic spats between China and the US, one of which led to Beijing’s highest-level political purge since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
In a wide-ranging farewell briefing on Wednesday, Mr Locke emphasised the importance of streamlining visa applications for Chinese tourists and business people.
“Part of the reason for doing that is to enable more Chinese to experience America, to see first-hand our freedoms, our democracy, our diversity,” he said.
“I hope that perhaps from their experiences in the US they’ll want some of those same things in China or understand what is possible in China.”
As Washington’s first Chinese-American ambassador to Beijing, Mr Locke has been a popular figure in China even while clashing with Chinese government officials on a number of fronts.
He will be succeeded by Max Baucus, a former Montana senator.
In a reference to the recent war of words between Beijing and Tokyo over a group of islands administered by Japan, Mr Locke warned both sides of “an unintended incident that leads to unintended consequences” and also spoke of the need for “more direct and instantaneous” communication between the US and Chinese militaries.
The People’s Liberation Army and the Pentagon established a “defence telephone link” after a Chinese jet collided with a US surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea in 2001.
But the DTL does not function as a direct hotline, as military-to-military discussions over it must be scheduled in advance.
“You need to make sure there are the right people available monitoring these attempts to communicate, whether it’s picking up the phone or receiving the email or the secure cables,” Mr Locke said.
“You can have all the mechanisms in the world, but if no one’s there to act upon it then it doesn’t make much sense.”
Mr Locke was unapologetic about his engagement with Tibetans and Uighurs – ethnic groups whose home regions in China are increasingly restive – as well as religious leaders and legal activists, saying US diplomats were eager to “learn about what they were doing and see how we could support them”.
“Human rights is about more than just economic prosperity,” Mr Locke said. “It is also about fundamental and universal rights, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly... We call on China to improve its record.”
The ambassador referred to the failed asylum request in 2012 of Wang Lijun, a former Chinese police chief, as a “very, very intense 48-hour period”.
Mr Wang’s flight to a US consulate led to the purge and prosecution of Bo Xilai, the then party head of Chongqing, China’s most populous city.
In guiding the renminbi into its steepest dive since 2005 this week, Beijing was employing a strategy of “one arrow, two vultures”, as the saying goes.
The first vulture denotes the international speculators who have – in spite of warnings by Chinese officials – regarded renminbi appreciation against the US dollar as a one-way bet.
The second vulture signifies the domestic shadow financiers who refuse to be brought down to earth.
Neither of Beijing’s avian quarries is dead or even mortally wounded, but the renminbi’s surprise decline will have ruffled plenty of feathers.
More importantly, it serves notice that China is opening up a new front in its battle to reduce risks in a highly volatile financial system.
It takes a little detective work to unravel how guiding the renminbi lower helps China manage financial risks because it involves a vast twilight zone of financial dealings for which there is little data, official or otherwise.
Nevertheless, it is the dealings in this zone – which includes domestic shadow finance and irregular cross-border capital flows – that are increasingly setting the tone for Beijing’s policies.
The story starts with the People’s Bank of China’s repeated failure to bring shadow finance to heel.
Since the announcement of Document 463 in December 2012, authorities have been turning up the pressure on shadow finance, mainly with the aim of preventing high-interest trust loans from triggering defaults among local government borrowers.
But official statistics show that such efforts have not yet borne fruit.
Entrusted loans rose to Rmb396.5bn ($64.7bn) in January, almost double the levels of the same month a year ago.
Worse than this failure, though, is evidence that the PBoC’s policies may be backfiring.
Dodging the central bank’s pressure to liquidate shadow financial assets (which offer attractive returns), banks are opting instead to sell off lower yielding enterprise bonds (debt issued by state-owned companies), thus raising the cost of financing to companies and local governments, according to research by China Confidential, a research service at the Financial Times.
While this squeezes the supply of credit to the “real” economy, the shadow finance segment is nourished by inflows of capital that gush through a hundred holes in China’s nominally “closed” capital account.
A shadow banker in Ningbo, eastern China, recently described the attractions of such a trade.
“It is easy to borrow abroad at around 1 per cent annual interest. Then change that money into renminbi and bring it into the mainland,” said the banker, who declined to be identified because of the illegal nature of his business.
“You can get around 10 to 12 per cent by lending it to a trust or around 20 per cent by putting it with an underground bank. On top of that you get whatever the renminbi has appreciated by the time you need to repay the foreign loan.”
One sign that this cross-border carry trade has been robust of late is evidence of an increase in the over-invoicing of exports, a common ruse used to spirit funds into the mainland.
A China Confidential survey of exporters in January found that 44 per cent of respondents thought that such fake invoicing was on the increase.
Besieged by these pressures, it is hardly surprising that the PBoC was keen to shoot an arrow.
Its hope is that by instilling in speculators’ consciousness a sense that the renminbi can fall as well as rise, it will staunch the inrush of speculative capital lured by the outsized returns available in the mainland’s shadow finance markets.
In this, as ever, Beijing is looking for incremental shifts, such as the 1.2 per cent that the renminbi has depreciated by so far this year.
It knows that if it were to try to stop the inflow of illegal capital entirely, it may trigger the very wave of financial defaults it is hoping to avoid.
Thus a gradual approach using exchange rate flexibility to generate a market response seems to suit the PBoC’s objectives for now.
One of China’s best known ethnic rights activists has been charged with “separatism” in the restive far western region of Xinjiang, in the latest sign of a tightening by the authorities in a region that is expected to receive a surge in industrial investment.
Ilham Tohti, an economist and the most prominent voice for Uighurs in China, has not been seen since security forces detained him with some of his students in Beijing in January.
His lawyer, Li Fangping, told the Financial Times on Wednesday that authorities in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, are refusing to meet him or allow him to see his client.
Xinjiang has been the scene of several violent clashes between security forces and local Uighur groups demanding more autonomy in recent years.
Mr Tohti’s detention came shortly before a Beijing court sentenced another progressive activist, Xu Zhiyong, to four years in prison for organising a movement that urged Communist party leaders to reveal their personal wealth.
Across the nation, dozens of less well-known ethnic rights activists, environmental campaigners, human rights activists and outspoken internet personalities have also been detained or jailed in the past year.
The Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people, make up about half the population of Xinjiang – an oil-rich, arid region on the Chinese border with central Asia.
Chinese security forces have reported several clashes with Uighurs in recent months, including two in Aksu prefecture in the past two months in which 20 “attackers” were shot by police or died in explosions.
Tohti and his Mandarin-language website Uighurbiz.net was one of the only channels within China willing to cite specific local grievances, economic inequality or instigation by authorities as the cause of clashes in Xinjiang.
The Chinese government nearly always attributes unrest in the region to terrorism.
Security forces have maintained a heavy presence in Xinjiang, particularly in the Uighur heartland around Kashgar, since Uighur rioters killed about 200 people, mostly ethnic Han Chinese, in Urumqi in July 2009.
A writer for Uighurbiz.net was jailed for 15 years for endangering state security after speaking to foreign journalists after the riot and posting critical articles online.
The crackdown on outspoken dissidents comes as Chinese state-owned companies prepare for huge mining and coal conversion projects in Xinjiang, which holds about 40 per cent of the nation’s coal reserves.
Most of those deposits were untapped until recently, but a decade-long central government push to “Develop the West” combined with more recent policies to reduce coal use in the more prosperous coastal cities has spurred investment in remote Xinjiang and across the arid north and west.
Xinjiang already accounts for almost one-third of Chinese domestic oil production and about 60 per cent of its cotton harvest.
Narendra Modi, the Indian opposition leader, has told China to abandon its “expansionist attitude” in a rare foray into foreign policy as his general election campaign gathers pace.
Mr Modi, prime ministerial candidate for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, was portraying himself as an Indian patriot in a weekend speech in the Himalayan border state of Arunachal Pradesh – a territory claimed in its entirety by neighbouring China.
“No power on earth can take away even an inch from India,” he told a rally in Pasighat in the far northeast of India. “China should give up its expansionist attitude and adopt a development mindset.”
He wore a traditional hat from the local Adi tribe decorated with a hornbill’s giant beak.
Mr Modi, who has focused until now on his plans to restore economic growth and boost investment and jobs in India, said: “I swear by this land that I will not let this nation be destroyed, I will not let this nation be divided, I will not let this nation bow down.”
India’s governing Congress party has in the past been equally insistent on rejecting China’s claims over Arunachal Pradesh, but Mr Modi is eager to burnish his nationalist credentials in the run-up to the election to be held within three months.
Sanjaya Baru, director for geoeconomics and strategy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a global security think-tank, likened Mr Modi to Shinzo Abe, the nationalist Japanese prime minister whose goals include economic revival as well as pushing his country to stand up to an increasingly assertive China.
“Modi would project himself as a more nationalistic leader, just in the way that Abe does,” said Mr Baru, adding that Indian foreign policy under a Modi government would probably not be fundamentally different to that of Manmohan Singh, the current Congress prime minister.
Chinese look to retail agents for a taste of luxury
May Liu earns about $2,500 a month as an office worker in Hong Kong, but she spends about 10 to 15 times that on luxury goods, buying everything from Prada handbags to products from US cosmetic brand Fresh.
While Ms Liu loves shopping, she buys mostly for others in her role as a “daigou” agent – a growing breed of people who specialise in helping mainland Chinese consumers secure products from overseas.
She started her daigou business a year ago as a way to earn more money, but the young mainland Chinese was soon bringing in up to $10,000 a month.
Ms Liu now has about 2,600 clients, who use Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, and WeChat, a messaging app, to order goods.
“I didn’t know how much money I would make. I didn’t have any expectation of profits,” says Ms Liu, who asked to use a pseudonym. “I only knew it would be profitable.”
She has not given up her day job, realising that being a daigou agent, while highly profitable, can also be illegal.
Some agents focus on ferrying goods from Hong Kong to mainland China.
But the web-based phenomenon has spread to expatriate Chinese who are help compatriots back home buy brands from cities such as Paris, London, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.
The daigou boom is an example of how ecommerce is rapidly transforming the Chinese retail market.
According to Chinese media, there are hundreds of thousands of people working in the daigou business.
A search for the term on Alibaba’s Taobao, China’s largest online marketplace, produces more than 240,000 virtual stores and nearly 15m items from child car seats through air purifiers to pocket printers.
The China e-Commerce Research Centre says the daigou market grew 19-fold between 2008 and 2012 when it reached Rmb48bn, and reckons that it rose again in 2013 to Rmb74bn ($12bn).
According to a recent study by Bain, about 60 per cent of the Chinese consumers who buy luxury goods have used daigou at some point.
The business is thriving for several reasons.
Many Chinese believe the same product is better made when bought overseas because of the mainland’s uneven reputation for quality.
The rising strength of the renminbi, the growing purchasing power of Chinese consumers, and high-profile food safety scandals in China, have also spurred demand for safe and high-quality foreign products.
Mo Daiqing, an analyst at the e-commerce research centre, says the main reason Chinese are turning to daigou is because of hefty import tariffs on luxury goods.
China levies a 50 per cent duty on cosmetics, one of the dominant daigou categories, and that is before the imposition of the standard 17 per cent value added tax that is added to imported luxury products.
“The same brands of milk powder, cosmetics and handbags are much cheaper in Hong Kong, the US, Japan and South Korea than in mainland China,” said Ms Mo.
But the industry is increasingly drawing attention from customs officials in mainland China and Hong Kong, particularly with the rising numbers of so-called parallel traders who take advantage of multi-entry visas to cross the border at the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen many times a day, carrying products for resale that they do not declare at customs.
Dong Yizhi, a lawyer who specialises in ecommerce, points out that the daigou business is not illegal if the agents pay import taxes, but says that if agents pay duties the premise of the business becomes moot.
“If they pay customs duties, the price disparities will be much smaller and they won’t make money,” said Mr Dong.
Chinese citizens can legally import Rmb5,000 ($823) of duty-free goods for personal use each time they return to the mainland.
But Shenzhen customs officers are taking a tougher line on parallel traders who cross the border back into the mainland more than once a day with goods over the value of Rmb500.
Liu Lizhen, a Shenzhen customs official, said the move was aimed at clamping down on the abuse of the multiple re-entry system.
This has become a more serious issue in Hong Kong since 2009 when it started allowing Shenzhen permanent residents to enter the former British colony without restrictions.
“We once found a person who had crossed the border 26 times a day,” said Ms Liu.
According to the Shenzhen customs bureau, more than 20,000 parallel traders operate at the six land border checkpoints between Hong Kong and the southern Chinese city.
Hong Kong’s immigration department said just over a thousand parallel traders were arrested last year for breaching the terms of their stay in the territory.
Despite the crackdown, May Liu, the daigou agent, says she is not worried, and still travels to Shenzhen a few times a week.
“Carrying so much stuff across the border every time provides me with a lot of exercise. I don’t even have to go to the gym,” jokes Ms Liu.
‘Brands are much cheaper in Hong Kong, the US, Japan and South Korea than China’
China closes net around former security chief
China has placed two high-ranking officials under investigation in moves that appear to close the net more tightly around the country’s powerful former security chief.
The detentions are the latest in a series that have targeted former colleagues of Zhou Yongkang, who ran China’s domestic security apparatus until 2012.
The Communist party is widely believed to have already placed Mr Zhou under virtual house arrest but it has yet to announce any legal action against him.
As a member of the nine-person politburo standing committee that ruled China, Mr Zhou, 71, is the most senior politician to be caught up in a corruption investigation in decades.
In a sign that the party could be tightening its grip around him, two more former allies have been detained, adding to a growing list already under investigation, according to reports.
Shen Dingcheng, Communist party secretary of PetroChina International, the state oil company, was detained before the Chinese New Year last month, according to China Business Journal newspaper.
Mr Shen had served as secretary to “a particular leader at China National Petroleum Corporation at some point between 1992 and 1997”, the newspaper reported.
It did not mention Mr Zhou by name but he was a top leader of CNPC during those years, building up a group of supporters that later came to be known as the country’s “petroleum faction”.
Three other secretaries of Mr Zhou from his time with the national oil company have already been detained.
Separately, the New York Times reported that Liang Ke, director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of State Security, was taken into custody last month by the party’s discipline inspection body.
The newspaper said he had been detained because of suspected corruption but added that his links to Mr Zhou also were a factor.
“Liang Ke was detained because he is suspected of assisting Zhou Yongkang beyond approved means and channels,” a former security official was quoted as saying.
Mr Zhou retired in 2012 and was last seen in public at a China University of Petroleum alumni celebration in October.
He had been a close ally of Bo Xilai, the former leadership hopeful who in September received a life sentence for corruption.
China’s Communist party has long acknowledged corruption as an existential threat to its continued rule.
Since Xi Jinping took power in late 2012, Beijing has launched investigations targeting some of the country’s most powerful officials and companies as well as waging a broader campaign to rein in lavish spending by officials.
Funds launched by the likes of Alibaba have been lambasted as parasites that are endangering China’s economic health by a prominent commentator, the latest salvo in a battle that pits new online funds against the traditional banking system they are shaking up.
The war of words over the weekend is a sign of the growing controversy over the online investment funds, which were launched less than a year ago but have already upended traditional business models in China’s banking system.
Alibaba, the ecommerce company behind the biggest of the funds, shot back at the criticism, saying that its product is providing a service to the economy by putting more money in ordinary people’s hands.
The Chinese government caps bank deposit interest rates to limit what it fears could be damaging competition in the financial sector.
Online investment funds offered by internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent have blown a hole in that ceiling by giving savers direct access to money-market funds.
Thus depositors receive a maximum 0.35 per cent, while those investing in the Alibaba and Tencent funds are more than 15 times better off with an annual rate of 6 per cent – prompting a rechannelling of cash from banks to online funds.
Regulators have so far done little to crimp the online funds’ development, viewing them as healthy innovations.
But the attack by Niu Wenxin, a financial editor with the state broadcaster China Central Television, suggests they could begin to face tougher opposition.
Mr Niu called for the outright prohibition of Alibaba’s Yu’e Bao fund.
“It is attacking the financing costs of Chinese society as a whole and attacking the overall economic safety of China,” he wrote in a blog post published on Friday.
“Yu’e Bao is like a vampire that has climbed on to the body of banks.”
With Mr Niu’s comments circulating widely, Alibaba used its official microblog early on Saturday to fight back.
In a post calculated to appeal to the general public, Alibaba said its fund was helping to make working people richer and the economy stronger.
“I used to have just two steamed vegetable buns in the morning. Now I can have two meat buns! This motivates me to work that much harder for our motherland’s economy every day,” Alibaba said.
A poor country triples its trade volume in six years. Exports to its main partner soar fivefold.
This is a rare feat for a nation not blessed with oil; rarer still for a country under UN Security Council sanctions, tightened three times during the same trade spurt.
We are talking of North Korea, believe it or not.
Unbelievers appear to include Kim Jong Un.
When the young leader brutally purged his uncle-mentor, Jang Song Thaek, in December the charge sheet included “selling off precious resources of the country at cheap prices”.
China does receive some (not all) North Korean minerals cheap, since no one else will buy.
But to be fair, on Jang’s watch – he oversaw trade with China – an economy still poorer on most indicators than when Moscow pulled the plug in 1991 began to grasp one big nettle: how to raise exports.
Pyongyang issues no numbers; when they do that, we will know for sure reform is under way.
But its partners’ recent trade statistics tell a striking story.
North Korea has never traded much, and has always run a deficit.
When the USSR collapsed, China was left as its main partner-cum-sponsor.
For many years their trade was more like aid.
In the late 1990s the value of imports from China averaged about $500m a year – though often they were not paid for.
Pyongyang exported next to nothing in return.
The debts mounted, as did Chinese impatience.
The deficit rose throughout the subsequent decade, reaching $1.3bn in 2008 – twice the level of Pyongyang’s exports.
In 2012 South Korean news agency Yonhap noted a startling change.
In just four years, starting in 2007, the value of trade had almost tripled to $5.6bn.
At the same time, it became less one-sided; North Korea’s exports more than quadrupled to $2.5bn.
That is still peanuts by regional and global standards, and the deficit narrowed rather than disappearing entirely.
But it began to look like serious, reciprocal trade.
The progress continues, if no longer at quite such a clip.
Latest Chinese customs statistics show that North Korean exports to China in 2013 rose 17 per cent to nearly $3bn, against imports of $3.6bn.
China apart, North Korea has, or had, only one crucial partner: South Korea: Pyongyang’s trade with the rest of the world in 2012 totalled less than $800m, according to Seoul’s Bank of Korea.
In 2007 after a decade of “sunshine”, the engagement pursued by two liberal presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, inter-Korean trade reached $1.8bn, snapping at China’s heels.
South Korea briefly became the North’s biggest export market as the joint venture Kaesong Industrial Complex, in the North but near to Seoul, grew.
Larger plans were afoot.
In 2007, at the second North-South summit, accords were signed for co-operation on shipbuilding, mining, transport and more.
A plethora of new joint committees started work quickly to implement all this.
For once the Koreas talked business, not politics.
Nothing came of it.
At the end of that year, South Koreans elected as president Lee Myung-bak, who insisted the North must first give up nuclear weapons.
The agreements were aborted and a downward spiral began.
In May 2010, after the sinking of a South Korean warship, Mr Lee banned all inter-Korean trade and all investment except at Kaesong.
That zone alone still generated record North-South trade of $2bn in 2012.
Meanwhile trade between China and North Korea leapt ahead.
Last April, Mr Kim sabotaged Kaesong, pulling out the North’s workers.
It reopened in September but the closure meant inter-Korean trade fell 42 per cent in 2013 to $1.1bn: an eight-year low, and barely one-sixth the value of trade with China.
North Korea is a risky place to do business, for Chinese as for others.
Yet well-publicised horror stories may mislead.
The numbers show that many Chinese companies have found a way to navigate the obstacles and make money.
They would not be there otherwise.
Beijing’s gain is Seoul’s loss.
Stillborn state-run projects aside, in the sunshine era a few bold companies from the South vied with China to do business in North Korea.
Outside Kaesong they all lost their shirts.
Yet it was not Kim Jong Il, the current leader’s father and predecessor, but Mr Lee who did for them.
The sectors affected (mining above all) mourn the chances lost, but politicians are in denial.
In January President Park Geun-hye told South Koreans to prepare for reunification, which she bizarrely called a “jackpot”.
But the Koreas can barely even agree to hold family reunions – the first in four years began this week – much less recoup ground lost under Mr Lee, whose trade ban remains in force.
Pyongyang always tries to play off its interlocutors against one another.
Conceivably, the mercurial Mr Kim might suddenly try to ditch China and re-embrace South Korea.
But Beijing will not let him and the cautious Ms Park would not have him.
Uncle Jang’s men may have fallen from favour but the trade ties he built will last.
Seoul blew its chance.
North Korea’s future now lies with China.
Nobel Prize winner Chen Ning Yang gives a talk at UM
Prof. Chen Ning Yang, the first Chinese winner of the Nobel Prize and a renowned physicist, gave a talk entitled “My Experience as Student and Researcher” at the University of Macau (UM) on 21 February.
The talk attracted a full-house audience consisting of UM teachers, students and the general public.
UM also arranged live broadcast in a classroom and on the intranet due to continued requests to register for the lecture after it was fully booked.
The talk was chaired by UM Rector Wei Zhao, who praised Prof. Yang for his internationally acclaimed academic achievements and said he is the pride of all Chinese people.
Wei Zhao expressed his hope that the talk could increase the students’ understanding of the world and give them new inspiration.
China urges Obama to cancel Dalai Lama meeting
China called on US President Barack Obama to immediately cancel a planned meeting with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, and warned the meeting would “severely impair” Sino-US relations if it goes ahead.
Mr Obama is scheduled to welcome the exiled septuagenarian Tibetan leader at 10am Washington time on Friday and will spend just over an hour with him in the White House Map Room.
Beijing regards the Dalai Lama as a political exile and a violent anti-China separatist and regularly imposes various sanctions and punishments on governments who meet him publicly.
The Tibetan leader is usually based in Dharamsala in India and has consistently advocated non-violence and repeatedly said he wants greater autonomy for Tibet rather than outright independence.
“By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama, the US side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China, seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-US relations,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday in Beijing.
The US President’s decision to meet the Dalai Lama is a show of concern for China’s human rights record but also appears aimed at warning Beijing it does not have the right to dictate who leaders of other countries can meet.
Mr Obama has met the Dalai Lama twice before, in February 2010 and July 2011.
Like virtually every other country, the US recognises Tibet as part of China and does not support Tibetan independence but Washington also supports the Dalai Lama’s call for more autonomy and improvement in human rights.
Diplomats and foreign policy analysts say European leaders are very unlikely to agree to a similar meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader in the wake of China’s livid response to meetings by the German, French and British heads of government in recent years.
Most recently, China reacted to a meeting between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the Dalai Lama in May 2012 by cutting off all high-level diplomatic ties for more than a year.
Relations only began to warm again after Mr Cameron reiterated Britain’s opposition to Tibetan independence in front of his colleagues in Parliament and later publicly stated he had no plans to meet the Dalai Lama again.
Tensions across the Tibetan plateau have been steadily rising in recent years, with widespread anger at Chinese religious and ethnic repression and the militarised occupation of many Tibetan areas.
Since 2009, more than 120 Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule and to call for the return of the Dalai Lama to his homeland.
Better-fed Chinese soldiers have trouble fitting into their tanks
China already has the largest army in the world.
Now its soldiers are getting bigger too.
A People’s Liberation Army study has concluded that its soldiers are significantly taller and fatter than they were 20 years ago – so much so that they are in danger of outgrowing their equipment.
The study recommended developing larger models of current military hardware because of the changed “parameters” of a generation raised on plentiful and fast food, compared with the austerity generation of the cultural revolution era.
The average height of soldiers, it said, is now 2cm greater than two decades ago, and waistlines are 5cm larger, which makes sliding into tank hatches and fitting into aircraft cockpits especially tricky.
Even the buttstocks of rifles produced for the PLA needed to be lengthened so as not to affect firing accuracy, the study said.
“The configuration of armaments and military personnel’s physique should be matched because that is the only way to ensure handy use of the equipment,” said Ding Songtao, director of the survey.
Bigger tanks will be the focus of the new generation of roomier equipment.
The low silhouettes of China’s main battle tanks – based on the 30-year-old Russian T-series – make them more difficult targets, but their compartments are too cramped for today’s beefier crews.
Owing to better nutrition, China’s younger generation is now much taller than its parents, although obesity is a problem.
A study by China’s health ministry in 2007 showed that urban Chinese boys aged six are 6.3cm taller and 3kg heavier on average than boys 30 years ago.
But the conclusion that the PLA’s 2.3m active personnel needed a range of supersized military hardware was met by derision from some analysts.
Jiang Lianju, a researcher with the China Academy of Military Sciences, said the size issue was a “very minor consideration” compared to technical specifications such as armour and combat effectiveness.
Ni Lexiong, a military expert based in Shanghai, said height and weight had always been a consideration in choosing tank crewmen.
“Choosing tank operators is like choosing weight-lifters – both require men to be short and quick.”
Rather than building larger tanks, it was more likely that their inside compartments could be enlarged, keeping overall size unchanged, he said.
John Kerry warns China against declaring second air defence zone
John Kerry, US secretary of state, warned China against declaring a second air defence zone three months after Beijing infuriated its neighbours by unilaterally declaring one over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Mr Kerry also said he sought agreement from Chinese officials to pursue their claims in the South China Sea in a peaceful manner, submit them for adjudication, and negotiate a code of conduct with other regional governments that would prevent maritime confrontations from getting out of control.
“It is important to resolve these disputes in a peaceful and non-confrontational way that honours the law of the sea and the rule of law in general,” he said during a visit to Beijing on Friday, amid heightened tensions between China and its neighbours over a range of maritime disputes.
In November China unilaterally declared an “air defence identification zone” in the East China Sea which overlaps with a similar zone declared by Japan and covers a disputed chain of islands.
The US strongly criticised the move at the time as a “provocative” action.
Ever since there has been speculation in the Chinese press about the declaration of a second ADIZ in the South China Sea to buttress territorial claims there.
Mr Kerry said in response to a question about a second ADIZ in the South China Sea: “With respect to the ADIZ we have indeed made clear our feelings about any unilateral announcements and I reiterated that again today. And I hope that whatever follows in the future will be done in an open transparent and accountable way.”
An ADIZ requires foreign aircraft entering the airspace to identify themselves, and Chinese officials have stressed it is not a territorial claim.
But Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the creation of the zone “may indirectly support territorial claims”.
Following criticism of the ADIZ last month, the US again singled out China’s territorial claims earlier this month when Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state, said in testimony to the US Congress that China’s claim to much of the South China sea, known as the “nine dash line”, was “fundamentally flawed”.
It was the first time the US has explicitly challenged the Chinese claim.
Wang Yi, Chinese foreign minister, told Mr Kerry on Friday that he hoped the US would respect China’s “sovereign rights”, “treat the issue objectively and fairly” and not take sides, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Tempers in Beijing are frayed because many Chinese believe they have the right to assert control of their environment in the western Pacific.
Wu Shicun, director of the South China Sea Institute, said: “I don’t think the US has a right to interfere in the issue; the US is trying to use the South China Sea as a vehicle to contain China.”
As we record this podcast, the Oscars are about to get underway in LA.

Coming up, an uneasy calm prevails in Crimea amid military standoff between Russia and Ukraine.
Meanwhile, in Moscow President Putin insists he still recognizes Ukraine’s ousted President Viktor Yanukovych as the legitimate leader.
“It’s clear he doesn't have any power. That’s understandable.
I want to repeat that the legitimate president in purely legal terms is of course Yanukovych.”
So what impact might this have for the US Secretary of States meeting in Kief with those who replaced him?
Also in this podcast, an ancient virus has been brought back to life by French scientists after lying dormant for at least 30,000 years.
And we’ll hear about the last letters written by Japanese Kamikaze pilots to their loved ones during the World War II.
“Dear mother, my one regret is I could not do more for you before I die.
But to die as a fighter for the Emperor is an honor. It is something you can feel happy about. Do not feel sad.”
Could climate change unleash deadly viruses that have lain dormant for thousands of years.
It’s possible according to a group of French scientists
who have for the first time revived an ancient virus that have been buried in Siberian permafrost for 30,000 years.
Fortunately, the one they found wasn't deadly to humans but it did cause some nasty damage to an amoeba they tested it on.
Our science reporter Rebecca Morelle spoke about the findings.
“It’s an absolutely incredible piece of research.
So the viruses was found varied about 30 meters down in the Siberian permafrost.
And it’s been lying there dormant, not doing anything for the last 30,000 years.
It’s also quite a weird virus, too. It’s very big in size.
You can actually see it under a microscope, which is really unusual for a virus and it’s the biggest scientists have found so old and revived.”
“And it’s under control or not?” “Yes. So the good news is this doesn't actually affect humans or animals.
But scientists all worried that there could be more deadly viruses lurking down there in the deep place at the permafrost, smallpox for example.
That was around thousands of years ago. It’s eradicated now on the surface, but there is a chance if those deep places were penetrated.”

so we don't know what they're trying to do, and there is a crowd of sort of people there who are pretty hostile, um,
we understand that some journalists get out of the car and take photographs,
now our report say they've probably been beaten, so we try to keep a very late presence, it looks quite a tense situation, you can imagine what the Ukrainian soldiers must have been going through inside,
because at the moment, the gates are still locked, but there is no sign of the base, that we've been to that they've driven through that gates.
Russian parliamentarians have given a standing ovation to a delegation of politicians from Crimea,

The former Turkish military chief, Ilker Basbug has been released from a life sentence, imposed for conspiring to overthrow the government.
In a televised statement, he said the Turkish nation had understood that he and other convicted officers had nothing to do with plotting coups.
He called for justice against those who'd had him locked up for more than two years. From Istanbul S G reports.
General Basbug's release could prove a turning point in the so-called Ergenekon trials in Turkey which have seen dozens of senior officers, lawyers and journalists jailed.
General Basbug was convicted of plotting to overthrow the government last year.
But on Thursday, Turkey's top court decided that the correct trial procedures had been followed.
The trials were seen as part of a long-running battle by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to tame Turkey's powerful armed forces.

The Syrian government says it's seized a town from rebels near the Lebanese border as part of its efforts to block their supply lines. Sebastian Usher reports.
Battles continue to rage across Syria, some more significant than others.
That's certainly how the Syrian government is talking up its recapture of the town of Zara.
It's important to the government because it's near the border with Lebanon, from where rebel fighters run vital supply lines for weapons and reinforcements.
President Assad's supporters are trying to block these, and may now be closed doing so.
Since last month, they've been bombarding in Yabroud, some 40 kilometers south along the border.
The storming of Zara maybe a foretaste of what's installed for that town's remaining residents.
Opposition activists say some of those left in Zara were killed in their homes.
Several thousand people have marched through the Lebanese capital Beirut to demand the passage of law, protecting women against domestic violence.
The rally coincides with International Women's Day.

When The Boss Works Long Hours, Do We All Have To?
The problem: Every night, your workaholic boss is still glued to the computer when you need to leave.
How to go home without looking like a slacker?
Should you sneak out, hoping to avoid a six o'clock showdown in the hall?
Guiltily apologize, promising to be on email all night?
Or just walk straight toward the door in the most professional way you can?
Many hard-working employees have an even harder-working boss who toils late into the night.
Career coaches and employees who have been there say the first priority should be conveying that you are still working hard -- and good at your job.
That requires communicating clearly and frequently about your progress and results.
Ideally, you want to figure out what the boss really needs and deliver it consistently enough that your hours become a non-issue.
Many employees assume managers value people for working day and night, and workplace trends support that belief: Two-thirds of workers are putting in much longer hours on the job than five years ago, according to a poll of 325 employees last fall by Right Management, Milwaukee, a talent and career-management company.
But before you get too hung up on work hours, check your assumptions about what the boss wants, says Cali Williams Yost, chief executive officer of Flex + Strategy Group, a Madison, N.J., training and consulting firm.
Managers work long hours for a variety of reasons: It may be a personal habit or preference, or perhaps they just don't want to go home.
'People make way too many guesses about managers' expectations that are just wrong,' Ms. Yost says.
Bosses are often taken aback by employees' focus on their schedules.
Betty Enyonam Kumahor often works 14-hour days, emailing and calling contacts around the world. 'My teams started tracking how many hours they thought I slept each night, based on my email 'send' times,' says Ms. Kumahor, a regional managing director in Atlanta for ThoughtWorks, a software-development company.
'They asked me jokingly, 'Do you ever sleep?'' She assured employees she would stop sending so many late-night and early-morning emails so they didn't have to extend their hours to respond.
When managers focus on employees' work hours, they are often looking for reassurance on other fronts: that their subordinates are meeting deadlines; that they can be reached when needed, and that they aren't creating extra work for colleagues, Ms. Yost says.
Rich Gee's boss on a former job took him aside and criticized him for leaving the office at 5 p.m., says Mr. Gee, a Stamford, Conn., executive coach.
The manager acknowledged that Mr. Gee was meeting deadlines and delivering good work; he arrived at the office at 6:30 a.m., two hours before his co-workers.
The boss seemed nervous, however, that Mr. Gee wouldn't be available when needed.
Mr. Gee said he could be reached 24/7 by cellphone, and pointed out that he always responded quickly to emergency requests.
He continued to leave the office at 5 p.m., but updated his boss often on his progress and results and checked in every evening before he left.
In time, he says, his boss 'saw that it wasn't hours that mattered -- it was how hard I worked.'
One key to Mr. Gee's solution: healthy communication.
Employees should sit down with their bosses and ask them to define job objectives and time lines for reaching them, says Pat Katepoo, the Kaneohe, Hawaii-based owner of WorkOptions, a consulting firm. Then 'look for natural times to communicate about your progress, when you have a staff meeting or you're walking by or writing an email,' says Ms. Katepoo.
There are many ways to project a hard-working image.
If a manager speaks about a project in an intense, focused way, answer with similar intensity, acknowledging its importance and repeating the deadline, says Anne Brown, an advertising executive who has written about how young employees can deal with workaholic bosses in a book, 'Grad to Great,' and on a website she co-founded, GradtoGreat.
Manage time well in one-on-one meetings, moving quickly through your agenda, adds Ms. Brown, of Kansas City, Mo. And, of course, be prepared to work long hours during a crisis or busy season, or when a major project deadline is looming.
In some cases, shifting your work hours can help.
At companies where managers focus on face time, employees who work 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. -- when more people are present -- are more likely to get noticed than those who work 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Executive coach Michael Melcher was told in a previous job at an investment bank that 'I wasn't working long enough hours,' he says. 'I started coming in later and staying later,' he says.
'A couple of months later, my boss said, 'It hasn't gone unnoticed that you're putting in additional hours.' '
Faking a presence at the office, however, doesn't work.
Throwing your coat over your chair as if you just stepped away, then leaving for the day, is likely to backfire, Ms. Yost says.
Colleagues will 'think you're there and run around like crazy people trying to find you.'
Another nonstarter, says Mr. Melcher, an executive coach with Next Step Partners, New York, is 'being a whiny complainer, with a lot of exasperated sighs, saying you're working your fingers to the bone. Nobody wants to hear that.'
In some professions, working long hours is unavoidable.
Certain firms' cultures breed intense competition and long hours among new hires, says Julie Cohen, a Philadelphia career and personal coach.
Others have unwritten cultural rules, such as, 'Nobody leaves the office before the boss leaves,' she says.
It is wise to prove yourself on the job for at least six months and ask a mentor for advice before exploring shorter hours, Ms. Cohen says.
'You might be stepping into a minefield if you don't understand the ins and outs of the organization.'
To get the most out of a negotiation about hours, Mr. Melcher says, think in advance about the boss's needs, and bring specifics documenting your own performance.
Start on a positive note, talking about what's going well.
Ask what the boss expects of employees when it comes to work hours and responding to email.
To propose solutions, Mr. Melcher recommends the 'yes . . .
and' technique: Affirm the boss's point, and then state your own.
For example: 'Yes, I want you to be able to rely on me after hours. And since I have young twins, it is important to me to be home between 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and spend that time with family. I could respond to you between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. How does that sound?'
Such conversations can open a dialogue -- or expose a brick wall.
When project manager Ashanti Stanford raised the issue with a boss at a previous job, the manager rolled her eyes and sighed. 'The expectation was, 'I have to work these hours, so why are you complaining?'' Ms. Stanford says. She has since moved on to a job with better hours.
It has long been said that a man with a good sense of humour can laugh a woman in to bed, despite his looks.
Now researchers believe the opposite may also be true - that we also find attractive members of the opposite sex more amusing.
Psychologists at the University of Stirling have discovered that good-looking people were perceived as funnier when the people listening to them could see what they looked like - i.e. whether they were attractive or not.
In the study, undergraduate psychology students were videoed while being asked which two items they would take to a desert island, and why.
They could pick from either chocolate, hairspray or a plastic bag.
While the students weren't told that the study was about humour, the vast majority gave the appearance of trying to be funny in their answers.
Other students were then asked to rate the desert-island comments for wit, as well as how attractive each of the commenters might be for a short-term or long-term relationship.
The researchers found that attractive individuals were rated as funnier in video clips than their less dashing counterparts.
Funnier men were also considered most attractive for a fling, the researchers found.
This might be because wit may give off the impression of not being serious or willing to commit to a long-term relationship.
Being recorded on video also made a real difference.
Men who were videoed were generally considered more amusing than those who only had their voices recorded and provided a photo of themselves.
One theory is that men, in particular, use humour as a mating signal, to show-off their intelligence and good genes to women.
Another is that we use wit to indicate we are sexually attracted to people.
The study was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.
10 biggest patent troll targets in business
Wireless carrier AT&T (T) was the top target of so-called patent trolls in 2013, having been sued more than 54 times by them in 2013—more than once a week.
This year's list of top ten patent troll targets was published today in a Fortune magazine feature story about RPX Corp.(RPXC), which compiled the statistics.
The article, called "Taking on the Trolls," states: "AT&T is no anomaly. Google (GOOG) was hit with 43 [such] suits last year; Verizon (VZ), 42; Apple (AAPL), 41; Samsung (SSNLF) and Amazon (AMZN), 39 each; Dell and Sony (SNE), 34 each; Huawei, 32; Blackberry (BBRY), 31. Every brand on this unenviable top-ten list was sued by [a patent troll] at least once every 12 days."
"Patent troll" is a pejorative term.
A more neutral term, and the one that RPX uses, is "non-practicing entity," or NPE.
An NPE is a company that sells no products or services of its own.
In their most controversial form, NPEs purchase patents on the open market and then assert them against operating companies, like AT&T and Google, seeking licensing fees and, often, suing to get them.
RPX is what's known as a defensive patent aggregator.
In exchange for a subscription fee—currently paid by some 168 companies, including Google, Verizon, and Samsung—it attempts to buy up potentially problematic patents on the open market, before NPEs can get their hands on them.
According to RPX's statistics—which have been relied upon by academics and government agencies—NPEs filed 3,608 new suits in 2013, up 19% from the 3,042 they filed in 2012, and their suits named 4,843 total defendants, up 13% from the 4,282 sued a year earlier.
NPE suits accounted for 67% of all new patent cases filed last year, and 63% of all new patent defendants, according to the figures RPX shared with Fortune.
